perltodo \- Perl TO\-DO List
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a list of wishes for Perl. The tasks we think are smaller or
easier are listed first. Anyone is welcome to work on any of these,
but it's a good idea to first contact \fIperl5\-porters@perl.org\fR to
avoid duplication of effort, and to learn from any previous attempts.
By all means contact a pumpking privately first if you prefer.
.PP
Whilst patches to make the list shorter are most welcome, ideas to add to
the list are also encouraged. Check the perl5\-porters archives for past
ideas, and any discussion about them. One set of archives may be found at:

What can we offer you in return? Fame, fortune, and everlasting glory? Maybe
not, but if your patch is incorporated, then we'll add your name to the
\&\fI\s-1AUTHORS\s0\fR file, which ships in the official distribution. How many other
programming languages offer you 1 line of immortality?

.Sh "Smartmatch design issues"
.IX Subsection "Smartmatch design issues"
In 5.10.0 the smartmatch operator \f(CW\*(C`~~\*(C'\fR isn't working quite \*(L"right\*(R". But
before we can fix the implementation, we need to define what \*(L"right\*(R" is.
The first problem is that Robin Houston implemented the Perl 6 smart match
spec as of February 2006, when smart match was axiomatically symmetrical:
<http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/msg/bf2b486f089ad021>
.PP
Since then the Perl 6 target moved, but the Perl 5 implementation did not.
.PP
So it would be useful for someone to compare the Perl 6 smartmatch table
as of February 2006 <http://svn.perl.org/viewvc/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/S03.pod?view=markup&pathrev=7615>
and the current table <http://svn.perl.org/viewvc/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/S03.pod?revision=14556&view=markup>
and tabulate the differences in Perl 6. The annotated view of changes is
<http://svn.perl.org/viewvc/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/S03.pod?view=annotate> and the diff is
\&\f(CW\*(C`svn diff \-r7615:14556 http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/S03.pod\*(C'\fR
\&\*(-- search for \f(CW\*(C`=head1 Smart matching\*(C'\fR. (In theory \fIviewvc\fR can generate that,
but in practice when I tried it hung forever, I assume \*(L"thinking\*(R")
.PP
With that done and published, someone (else) can then map any changed Perl 6
semantics back to Perl 5, based on how the existing semantics map to Perl 5:
<http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/perl\-5.10.0/pod/perlsyn.pod#Smart_matching_in_detail>

.Sh "Remove duplication of test setup."
.IX Subsection "Remove duplication of test setup."
Schwern notes, that there's duplication of code \- lots and lots of tests have
some variation on the big block of \f(CW$Is_Foo\fR checks.  We can safely put this
into a file, change it to build an \f(CW%Is\fR hash and require it.  Maybe just put
it into \fItest.pl\fR. Throw in the handy tainting subroutines.
.Sh "\s-1POD\s0 \-> \s-1HTML\s0 conversion in the core still sucks"
.IX Subsection "POD -> HTML conversion in the core still sucks"
Which is crazy given just how simple \s-1POD\s0 purports to be, and how simple \s-1HTML\s0
can be. It's not actually \fIas\fR simple as it sounds, particularly with the
flexibility \s-1POD\s0 allows for \f(CW\*(C`=item\*(C'\fR, but it would be good to improve the
visual appeal of the \s-1HTML\s0 generated, and to avoid it having any validation
errors. See also \*(L"make \s-1HTML\s0 install work\*(R", as the layout of installation tree
is needed to improve the cross\-linking.
.PP
The addition of \f(CW\*(C`Pod::Simple\*(C'\fR and its related modules may make this task
easier to complete.
.Sh "merge checkpods and podchecker"
.IX Subsection "merge checkpods and podchecker"
\&\fIpod/checkpods.PL\fR (and \f(CW\*(C`make check\*(C'\fR in the \fIpod/\fR subdirectory)
implements a very basic check for pod files, but the errors it discovers
aren't found by podchecker. Add this check to podchecker, get rid of
checkpods and have \f(CW\*(C`make check\*(C'\fR use podchecker.
.Sh "Parallel testing"
.IX Subsection "Parallel testing"
(This probably impacts much more than the core: also the Test::Harness
and TAP::* modules on \s-1CPAN\s0.)
.PP
All of the tests in \fIt/\fR can now be run in parallel, if \f(CW$ENV{TEST_JOBS}\fR
is set. However, tests within each directory in \fIext\fR and \fIlib\fR are still
run in series, with directories run in parallel. This is an adequate
heuristic, but it might be possible to relax it further, and get more
throughput. Specifically, it would be good to audit all of \fIlib/*.t\fR, and
make them use \f(CW\*(C`File::Temp\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "Make Schwern poorer"
.IX Subsection "Make Schwern poorer"
We should have tests for everything. When all the core's modules are tested,
Schwern has promised to donate to \f(CW$500\fR to \s-1TPF\s0. We may need volunteers to
hold him upside down and shake vigorously in order to actually extract the
cash.
.Sh "Improve the coverage of the core tests"
.IX Subsection "Improve the coverage of the core tests"
Use Devel::Cover to ascertain the core modules's test coverage, then add
tests that are currently missing.
.Sh "test B"
.IX Subsection "test B"
A full test suite for the B module would be nice.
.Sh "Deparse inlined constants"
.IX Subsection "Deparse inlined constants"
Code such as this
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use constant PI => 4;
\&    warn PI
.Ve
.PP
will currently deparse as
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use constant ('PI', 4);
\&    warn 4;
.Ve
.PP
because the tokenizer inlines the value of the constant subroutine \f(CW\*(C`PI\*(C'\fR.
This allows various compile time optimisations, such as constant folding
and dead code elimination. Where these haven't happened (such as the example
above) it ought be possible to make B::Deparse work out the name of the
original constant, because just enough information survives in the symbol
table to do this. Specifically, the same scalar is used for the constant in
the optree as is used for the constant subroutine, so by iterating over all
symbol tables and generating a mapping of \s-1SV\s0 address to constant name, it
would be possible to provide B::Deparse with this functionality.
.Sh "A decent benchmark"
.IX Subsection "A decent benchmark"
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlbench\*(C'\fR seems impervious to any recent changes made to the perl core. It
would be useful to have a reasonable general benchmarking suite that roughly
represented what current perl programs do, and measurably reported whether
tweaks to the core improve, degrade or don't really affect performance, to
guide people attempting to optimise the guts of perl. Gisle would welcome
new tests for perlbench.
.Sh "fix tainting bugs"
.IX Subsection "fix tainting bugs"
Fix the bugs revealed by running the test suite with the \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR switch (via
\&\f(CW\*(C`make test.taintwarn\*(C'\fR).
.Sh "Dual life everything"
.IX Subsection "Dual life everything"
As part of the \*(L"dists\*(R" plan, anything that doesn't belong in the smallest perl
distribution needs to be dual lifed. Anything else can be too. Figure out what
changes would be needed to package that module and its tests up for \s-1CPAN\s0, and
do so. Test it with older perl releases, and fix the problems you find.
.PP
To make a minimal perl distribution, it's useful to look at
\&\fIt/lib/commonsense.t\fR.
.Sh "Bundle dual life modules in ext/"
.IX Subsection "Bundle dual life modules in ext/"
For maintenance (and branch merging) reasons, it would be useful to move
some architecture-independent dual-life modules from lib/ to ext/, if this
has no negative impact on the build of perl itself.
.Sh "\s-1POSIX\s0 memory footprint"
.IX Subsection "POSIX memory footprint"
Ilya observed that use \s-1POSIX\s0; eats memory like there's no tomorrow, and at
various times worked to cut it down. There is probably still fat to cut out \-
for example \s-1POSIX\s0 passes Exporter some very memory hungry data structures.
.Sh "embed.pl/makedef.pl"
.IX Subsection "embed.pl/makedef.pl"
There is a script \fIembed.pl\fR that generates several header files to prefix
all of Perl's symbols in a consistent way, to provide some semblance of
namespace support in \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR. Functions are declared in \fIembed.fnc\fR, variables
in \fIinterpvar.h\fR. Quite a few of the functions and variables
are conditionally declared there, using \f(CW\*(C`#ifdef\*(C'\fR. However, \fIembed.pl\fR
doesn't understand the C macros, so the rules about which symbols are present
when is duplicated in \fImakedef.pl\fR. Writing things twice is bad, m'kay.
It would be good to teach \f(CW\*(C`embed.pl\*(C'\fR to understand the conditional
compilation, and hence remove the duplication, and the mistakes it has caused.
.Sh "use strict; and AutoLoad"
.IX Subsection "use strict; and AutoLoad"
Currently if you write
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    package Whack;
\&    use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';
\&    use strict;
\&    1;
\&    __END__
\&    sub bloop {
\&        print join (' ', No, strict, here), "!\en";
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
then \f(CW\*(C`use strict;\*(C'\fR isn't in force within the autoloaded subroutines. It would
be more consistent (and less surprising) to arrange for all lexical pragmas
in force at the _\|_END_\|_ block to be in force within each autoloaded subroutine.
.PP
There's a similar problem with SelfLoader.
.Sh "profile installman"
.IX Subsection "profile installman"
The \fIinstallman\fR script is slow. All it is doing text processing, which we're
told is something Perl is good at. So it would be nice to know what it is doing
that is taking so much \s-1CPU\s0, and where possible address it.
.SH "Tasks that need a little sysadmin-type knowledge"
.IX Header "Tasks that need a little sysadmin-type knowledge"
Or if you prefer, tasks that you would learn from, and broaden your skills
base...
.Sh "make \s-1HTML\s0 install work"
.IX Subsection "make HTML install work"
There is an \f(CW\*(C`installhtml\*(C'\fR target in the Makefile. It's marked as
\&\*(L"experimental\*(R". It would be good to get this tested, make it work reliably, and
remove the \*(L"experimental\*(R" tag. This would include
.IP "1" 4
.IX Item "1"
Checking that cross linking between various parts of the documentation works.
In particular that links work between the modules (files with \s-1POD\s0 in \fIlib/\fR)
and the core documentation (files in \fIpod/\fR)
.IP "2" 4
.IX Item "2"
Work out how to split \f(CW\*(C`perlfunc\*(C'\fR into chunks, preferably one per function
group, preferably with general case code that could be used elsewhere.
Challenges here are correctly identifying the groups of functions that go
together, and making the right named external cross-links point to the right
page. Things to be aware of are \f(CW\*(C`\-X\*(C'\fR, groups such as \f(CW\*(C`getpwnam\*(C'\fR to
\&\f(CW\*(C`endservent\*(C'\fR, two or more \f(CW\*(C`=items\*(C'\fR giving the different parameter lists, such
as
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH,REPLACEMENT
\&    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH
\&    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET
.Ve
.Sp
and different parameter lists having different meanings. (eg \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR)
.Sh "compressed man pages"
.IX Subsection "compressed man pages"
Be able to install them. This would probably need a configure test to see how
the system does compressed man pages (same directory/different directory?
same filename/different filename), as well as tweaking the \fIinstallman\fR script
to compress as necessary.
.Sh "Add a code coverage target to the Makefile"
.IX Subsection "Add a code coverage target to the Makefile"
Make it easy for anyone to run Devel::Cover on the core's tests. The steps
to do this manually are roughly
.IP "\(bu" 4
do a normal \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR, but include Devel::Cover as a module to install
(see \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR for how to do this)
.IP "\(bu" 4
.Vb 1
\&    make perl
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
.Vb 1
\&    cd t; HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-MDevel::Cover ./perl -I../lib harness
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Process the resulting Devel::Cover database
.PP
This just give you the coverage of the \fI.pm\fRs. To also get the C level
coverage you need to
.IP "\(bu" 4
Additionally tell \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR to use the appropriate C compiler flags for
\&\f(CW\*(C`gcov\*(C'\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
.Vb 1
\&    make perl.gcov
.Ve
.Sp
(instead of \f(CW\*(C`make perl\*(C'\fR)
.IP "\(bu" 4
After running the tests run \f(CW\*(C`gcov\*(C'\fR to generate all the \fI.gcov\fR files.
(Including down in the subdirectories of \fIext/\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
(From the top level perl directory) run \f(CW\*(C`gcov2perl\*(C'\fR on all the \f(CW\*(C`.gcov\*(C'\fR files
to get their stats into the cover_db directory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Then process the Devel::Cover database
.PP
It would be good to add a single switch to \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR to specify that you
wanted to perform perl level coverage, and another to specify C level
coverage, and have \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR and the \fIMakefile\fR do all the right things
automatically.
.Sh "Make Config.pm cope with differences between built and installed perl"
.IX Subsection "Make Config.pm cope with differences between built and installed perl"
Quite often vendors ship a perl binary compiled with their (pay\-for)
compilers.  People install a free compiler, such as gcc. To work out how to
build extensions, Perl interrogates \f(CW%Config\fR, so in this situation
\&\f(CW%Config\fR describes compilers that aren't there, and extension building
fails. This forces people into choosing between re-compiling perl themselves
using the compiler they have, or only using modules that the vendor ships.
.PP
It would be good to find a way teach \f(CW\*(C`Config.pm\*(C'\fR about the installation setup,
possibly involving probing at install time or later, so that the \f(CW%Config\fR in
a binary distribution better describes the installed machine, when the
installed machine differs from the build machine in some significant way.
.Sh "linker specification files"
.IX Subsection "linker specification files"
Some platforms mandate that you provide a list of a shared library's external
symbols to the linker, so the core already has the infrastructure in place to
do this for generating shared perl libraries. My understanding is that the
\&\s-1GNU\s0 toolchain can accept an optional linker specification file, and restrict
visibility just to symbols declared in that file. It would be good to extend
\&\fImakedef.pl\fR to support this format, and to provide a means within
\&\f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR to enable it. This would allow Unix users to test that the
export list is correct, and to build a perl that does not pollute the global
namespace with private symbols.
.Sh "Cross-compile support"
.IX Subsection "Cross-compile support"
Currently \f(CW\*(C`Configure\*(C'\fR understands \f(CW\*(C`\-Dusecrosscompile\*(C'\fR option. This option
arranges for building \f(CW\*(C`miniperl\*(C'\fR for \s-1TARGET\s0 machine, so this \f(CW\*(C`miniperl\*(C'\fR is
assumed then to be copied to \s-1TARGET\s0 machine and used as a replacement of full
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR executable.
.PP
This could be done little differently. Namely \f(CW\*(C`miniperl\*(C'\fR should be built for
\&\s-1HOST\s0 and then full \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR with extensions should be compiled for \s-1TARGET\s0.
This, however, might require extra trickery for \f(CW%Config:\fR we have one config
first for \s-1HOST\s0 and then another for \s-1TARGET\s0.  Tools like MakeMaker will be
mightily confused.  Having around two different types of executables and
libraries (\s-1HOST\s0 and \s-1TARGET\s0) makes life interesting for Makefiles and
shell (and Perl) scripts.  There is \f(CW$Config\fR{run}, normally empty, which
can be used as an execution wrapper.  Also note that in some
cross\-compilation/execution environments the \s-1HOST\s0 and the \s-1TARGET\s0 do
not see the same filesystem(s), the \f(CW$Config\fR{run} may need to do some
file/directory copying back and forth.
.Sh "roffitall"
.IX Subsection "roffitall"
Make \fIpod/roffitall\fR be updated by \fIpod/buildtoc\fR.
.ie n .Sh "Split ""linker"" from ""compiler"""
.el .Sh "Split ``linker'' from ``compiler''"
.IX Subsection "Split linker from compiler"
Right now, Configure probes for two commands, and sets two variables:
.ie n .IP "* ""cc""\fR (in \fIcc.U)" 4
.el .IP "* \f(CWcc\fR (in \fIcc.U\fR)" 4
.IX Item "cc (in cc.U)"
This variable holds the name of a command to execute a C compiler which
can resolve multiple global references that happen to have the same
name.  Usual values are \fIcc\fR and \fIgcc\fR.
Fervent \s-1ANSI\s0 compilers may be called \fIc89\fR.  \s-1AIX\s0 has \fIxlc\fR.
.ie n .IP "* ""ld""\fR (in \fIdlsrc.U)" 4
.el .IP "* \f(CWld\fR (in \fIdlsrc.U\fR)" 4
.IX Item "ld (in dlsrc.U)"
This variable indicates the program to be used to link
libraries for dynamic loading.  On some systems, it is \fIld\fR.
On \s-1ELF\s0 systems, it should be \f(CW$cc\fR.  Mostly, we'll try to respect
the hint file setting.
.PP
There is an implicit historical assumption from around Perl5.000alpha
something, that \f(CW$cc\fR is also the correct command for linking object files
together to make an executable. This may be true on Unix, but it's not true
on other platforms, and there are a maze of work arounds in other places (such
as \fIMakefile.SH\fR) to cope with this.
.PP
Ideally, we should create a new variable to hold the name of the executable
linker program, probe for it in \fIConfigure\fR, and centralise all the special
case logic there or in hints files.
.PP
A small bikeshed issue remains \- what to call it, given that \f(CW$ld\fR is already
taken (arguably for the wrong thing now, but on SunOS 4.1 it is the command
for creating dynamically-loadable modules) and \f(CW$link\fR could be confused with
the Unix command line executable of the same name, which does something
completely different. Andy Dougherty makes the counter argument "In parrot, I

The C code uses the macro \f(CW\*(C`PERL_UNUSED_ARG\*(C'\fR to stop compilers warning about
unused arguments. Often the arguments can't be removed, as there is an

Natively 64\-bit systems need neither \-Duse64bitint nor \-Duse64bitall.

.Sh "Make it clear from \-v if this is the exact official release"
.IX Subsection "Make it clear from -v if this is the exact official release"
Currently perl from \f(CW\*(C`p4\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`rsync\*(C'\fR ships with a \fIpatchlevel.h\fR file that
usually defines one local patch, of the form \*(L"\s-1MAINT12345\s0\*(R" or \*(L"\s-1RC1\s0\*(R". The output
of perl \-v doesn't report that a perl isn't an official release, and this
information can get lost in bugs reports. Because of this, the minor version
isn't bumped up until \s-1RC\s0 time, to minimise the possibility of versions of perl
escaping that believe themselves to be newer than they actually are.
.PP
It would be useful to find an elegant way to have the \*(L"this is an interim
maintenance release\*(R" or \*(L"this is a release candidate\*(R" in the terse \-v output,
and have it so that it's easy for the pumpking to remove this just as the
release tarball is rolled up. This way the version pulled out of rsync would
always say \*(L"I'm a development release\*(R" and it would be safe to bump the
reported minor version as soon as a release ships, which would aid perl
developers.
.PP
This task is really about thinking of an elegant way to arrange the C source
such that it's trivial for the Pumpking to flag \*(L"this is an official release\*(R"
when making a tarball, yet leave the default source saying \*(L"I'm not the
official release\*(R".
.Sh "Profile Perl \- am I hot or not?"
.IX Subsection "Profile Perl - am I hot or not?"
The Perl source code is stable enough that it makes sense to profile it,
identify and optimise the hotspots. It would be good to measure the
performance of the Perl interpreter using free tools such as cachegrind,
gprof, and dtrace, and work to reduce the bottlenecks they reveal.
.PP
As part of this, the idea of \fIpp_hot.c\fR is that it contains the \fIhot\fR ops,
the ops that are most commonly used. The idea is that by grouping them, their
object code will be adjacent in the executable, so they have a greater chance
of already being in the \s-1CPU\s0 cache (or swapped in) due to being near another op
already in use.
.PP
Except that it's not clear if these really are the most commonly used ops. So
as part of exercising your skills with coverage and profiling tools you might
want to determine what ops \fIreally\fR are the most commonly used. And in turn
suggest evictions and promotions to achieve a better \fIpp_hot.c\fR.
.PP
One piece of Perl code that might make a good testbed is \fIinstallman\fR.
.Sh "Allocate OPs from arenas"
.IX Subsection "Allocate OPs from arenas"
Currently all new \s-1OP\s0 structures are individually \fImalloc()\fRed and \fIfree()\fRd.
All \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR implementations have space overheads, and are now as fast as
custom allocates so it would both use less memory and less \s-1CPU\s0 to allocate
the various \s-1OP\s0 structures from arenas. The \s-1SV\s0 arena code can probably be
re-used for this.
.PP
Note that Configuring perl with \f(CW\*(C`\-Accflags=\-DPL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC\*(C'\fR will use
\&\fIPerl_Slab_alloc()\fR to pack optrees into a contiguous block, which is
probably superior to the use of \s-1OP\s0 arenas, esp. from a cache locality

Visual \*(C+ 2005 (\s-1VC++\s0 8.x) deprecated a number of \s-1CRT\s0 functions on the basis
that they were \*(L"unsafe\*(R" and introduced differently named secure versions of
them as replacements, e.g. instead of writing
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
one should now write
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    FILE* f;

.Ve
.PP
Currently, the warnings about these deprecations have been disabled by adding
\&\-D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE to the \s-1CFLAGS\s0. It would be nice to remove that
warning suppressant and actually make use of the new secure \s-1CRT\s0 functions.
.PP
There is also a similar issue with \s-1POSIX\s0 \s-1CRT\s0 function names like fileno having
been deprecated in favour of \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ conformant names like _fileno. These
warnings are also currently suppressed by adding \-D_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE. It
might be nice to do as Microsoft suggest here too, although, unlike the secure

.Sh "Fix \fIPOSIX::access()\fP and \fIchdir()\fP on Win32"
.IX Subsection "Fix POSIX::access() and chdir() on Win32"
These functions currently take no account of DACLs and therefore do not behave
correctly in situations where access is restricted by DACLs (as opposed to the
read-only attribute).
.PP
Furthermore, \fIPOSIX::access()\fR behaves differently for directories having the
read-only attribute set depending on what \s-1CRT\s0 library is being used. For
example, the \fI_access()\fR function in the \s-1VC6\s0 and \s-1VC7\s0 CRTs (wrongly) claim that
such directories are not writable, whereas in fact all directories are writable
unless access is denied by DACLs. (In the case of directories, the read-only
attribute actually only means that the directory cannot be deleted.) This \s-1CRT\s0
bug is fixed in the \s-1VC8\s0 and \s-1VC9\s0 CRTs (but, of course, the directory may still
not actually be writable if access is indeed denied by DACLs).
.PP
For the \fIchdir()\fR issue, see ActiveState bug #74552:
http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=74552
.PP
Therefore, DACLs should be checked both for consistency across CRTs and for
the correct answer.
.PP
(Note that perl's \-w operator should not be modified to check DACLs. It has
been written so that it reflects the state of the read-only attribute, even
for directories (whatever \s-1CRT\s0 is being used), for symmetry with \fIchmod()\fR.)

not. It would need some suitable benchmarking first. In particular, \f(CW\*(C`GP\*(C'\fRs

probably aren't allocated/deallocated often enough for a speed saving. Whereas

Unfortunately, it only works with \*(L"unsafe\*(R" signals, because under safe

detail of the string. Likewise, case folding behaviour is dependent on the
\&\s-1UTF8\s0 internal flag being on or off.
.Sh "Properly Unicode safe tokeniser and pads."
.IX Subsection "Properly Unicode safe tokeniser and pads."
The tokeniser isn't actually very \s-1UTF\-8\s0 clean. \f(CW\*(C`use utf8;\*(C'\fR is a hack \-
variable names are stored in stashes as raw bytes, without the utf\-8 flag
set. The pad \s-1API\s0 only takes a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR pointer, so that's all bytes too. The
tokeniser ignores the UTF\-8\-ness of \f(CW\*(C`PL_rsfp\*(C'\fR, or any SVs returned from
source filters.  All this could be fixed.

Currently this is illegal:

.Ve
.PP
In Perl 6, \f(CW\*(C`state ($a) = foo();\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`(state $a) = foo();\*(C'\fR have different
semantics, which is tricky to implement in Perl 5 as currently they produce
the same opcode trees. The Perl 6 design is firm, so it would be good to
implement the necessary code in Perl 5. There are comments in
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_newASSIGNOP()\*(C'\fR that show the code paths taken by various assignment
constructions involving state variables.
.ie n .Sh "Implement $value\fP ~~ 0 .. \f(CW$range"
.el .Sh "Implement \f(CW$value\fP ~~ 0 .. \f(CW$range\fP"

understand numeric (and maybe alphanumeric) ranges.

Currently contexts are void, scalar and list. split has a special mechanism in

At the moment pp_entersub is huge, and has code to deal with entering both

.PP
Those would be nice to add to Perl 5. That could be done without new ops.
.Sh "Virtualize operating system access"
.IX Subsection "Virtualize operating system access"
Implement a set of \*(L"vtables\*(R" that virtualizes operating system access
(\fIopen()\fR, \fImkdir()\fR, \fIunlink()\fR, \fIreaddir()\fR, \fIgetenv()\fR, etc.)  At the very
least these interfaces should take SVs as \*(L"name\*(R" arguments instead of
bare char pointers; probably the most flexible and extensible way
would be for the Perl-facing interfaces to accept HVs.  The system
needs to be per-operating-system and per-file-system
hookable/filterable, preferably both from \s-1XS\s0 and Perl level
(\*(L"Files and Filesystems\*(R" in perlport is good reading at this point,
in fact, all of perlport is.)
.PP
This has actually already been implemented (but only for Win32),
take a look at \fIiperlsys.h\fR and \fIwin32/perlhost.h\fR.  While all Win32
variants go through a set of \*(L"vtables\*(R" for operating system access,
non\-Win32 systems currently go straight for the POSIX/UNIX\-style
system/library call.  Similar system as for Win32 should be
implemented for all platforms.  The existing Win32 implementation
probably does not need to survive alongside this proposed new
implementation, the approaches could be merged.
.PP
What would this give us?  One often-asked-for feature this would
enable is using Unicode for filenames, and other \*(L"names\*(R" like \f(CW%ENV\fR,
usernames, hostnames, and so forth.
(See \*(L"When Unicode Does Not Happen\*(R" in perlunicode.)
.PP
But this kind of virtualization would also allow for things like
virtual filesystems, virtual networks, and \*(L"sandboxes\*(R" (though as long
as dynamic loading of random object code is allowed, not very safe
sandboxes since external code of course know not of Perl's vtables).
An example of a smaller \*(L"sandbox\*(R" is that this feature can be used to
implement per-thread working directories: Win32 already does this.

.Sh "Store the current pad in the \s-1OP\s0 slab allocator"
.IX Subsection "Store the current pad in the OP slab allocator"
Currently we leak ops in various cases of parse failure. I suggested that we
could solve this by always using the op slab allocator, and walking it to
free ops. Dave comments that as some ops are already freed during optree
creation one would have to mark which ops are freed, and not double free them
when walking the slab. He notes that one problem with this is that for some ops
you have to know which pad was current at the time of allocation, which does
change. I suggested storing a pointer to the current pad in the memory allocated
for the slab, and swapping to a new slab each time the pad changes. Dave thinks
that this would work.
.Sh "repack the optree"
.IX Subsection "repack the optree"
Repacking the optree after execution order is determined could allow
removal of \s-1NULL\s0 ops, and optimal ordering of OPs with respect to cache-line
filling.  The slab allocator could be reused for this purpose.  I think that
the best way to do this is to make it an optional step just before the
completed optree is attached to anything else, and to use the slab allocator
unchanged, so that freeing ops is identical whether or not this step runs.
Note that the slab allocator allocates ops downwards in memory, so one would
have to actually \*(L"allocate\*(R" the ops in reverse-execution order to get them
contiguous in memory in execution order.
.PP
See http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2007/12/msg131975.html
.PP
Note that running this copy, and then freeing all the old location ops would
cause their slabs to be freed, which would eliminate possible memory wastage if
the previous suggestion is implemented, and we swap slabs more frequently.

where the line of the second warning was misreported \- it should be line 5.
Rafael fixed this \- the problem arose because there was no nextstate \s-1OP\s0
between the execution of the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`elsif\*(C'\fR, hence \f(CW\*(C`PL_curcop\*(C'\fR still
reports that the currently executing line is line 4. The solution was to inject
a nextstate OPs for each \f(CW\*(C`elsif\*(C'\fR, although it turned out that the nextstate
\&\s-1OP\s0 needed to be a nulled \s-1OP\s0, rather than a live nextstate \s-1OP\s0, else other line
numbers became misreported. (Jenga!)
.PP
The problem is more general than \f(CW\*(C`elsif\*(C'\fR (although the \f(CW\*(C`elsif\*(C'\fR case is the
most common and the most confusing). Ideally this code
.PP

(rather than lines 4 and 5), but this would seem to require every \s-1OP\s0 to carry
(at least) line number information.
.PP
What might work is to have an optional line number in memory just before the
\&\s-1BASEOP\s0 structure, with a flag bit in the op to say whether it's present.
Initially during compile every \s-1OP\s0 would carry its line number. Then add a late
pass to the optimiser (potentially combined with \*(L"repack the optree\*(R") which
looks at the two ops on every edge of the graph of the execution path. If
the line number changes, flags the destination \s-1OP\s0 with this information.
Once all paths are traced, replace every op with the flag with a
nextstate-light op (that just updates \f(CW\*(C`PL_curcop\*(C'\fR), which in turn then passes
control on to the true op. All ops would then be replaced by variants that
do not store the line number. (Which, logically, why it would work best in
conjunction with \*(L"repack the optree\*(R", as that is already copying/reallocating
all the OPs)
.PP

.Sh "optimize tail-calls"
.IX Subsection "optimize tail-calls"
Tail-calls present an opportunity for broadly applicable optimization;
anywhere that \f(CW\*(C`return foo(...)\*(C'\fR is called, the outer return can
be replaced by a goto, and foo will return directly to the outer
caller, saving (conservatively) 25% of perl's call&return cost, which
is relatively higher than in C.  The scheme language is known to do
this heavily.  B::Concise provides good insight into where this
optimization is possible, ie anywhere entersub,leavesub op-sequence
occurs.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& perl -MO=Concise,-exec,a,b,-main -e 'sub a{ 1 }; sub b {a()}; b(2)'
.Ve
.PP
Bottom line on this is probably a new pp_tailcall function which
combines the code in pp_entersub, pp_leavesub.  This should probably
be done 1st in \s-1XS\s0, and using B::Generate to patch the new \s-1OP\s0 into the
optrees.
