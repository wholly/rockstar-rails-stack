.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1CPAN\s0 module automates or at least simplifies the make and install
of perl modules and extensions. It includes some primitive searching
capabilities and knows how to use Net::FTP or \s-1LWP\s0 or some external
download clients to fetch the distributions from the net.
.PP
These are fetched from one or more of the mirrored \s-1CPAN\s0 (Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network) sites and unpacked in a dedicated directory.
.PP
The \s-1CPAN\s0 module also supports the concept of named and versioned
\&\fIbundles\fR of modules. Bundles simplify the handling of sets of
related modules. See Bundles below.
.PP
The package contains a session manager and a cache manager. The
session manager keeps track of what has been fetched, built and
installed in the current session. The cache manager keeps track of the
disk space occupied by the make processes and deletes excess space
according to a simple \s-1FIFO\s0 mechanism.
.PP
All methods provided are accessible in a programmer style and in an
interactive shell style.
.ie n .Sh "CPAN::shell([$prompt, $command]) Starting Interactive Mode"
.el .Sh "CPAN::shell([$prompt, \f(CW$command\fP]) Starting Interactive Mode"
.IX Subsection "CPAN::shell([$prompt, $command]) Starting Interactive Mode"
The interactive mode is entered by running
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl -MCPAN -e shell
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cpan
.Ve
.PP
which puts you into a readline interface. If \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadKey\*(C'\fR and
either \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Perl\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Term::ReadLine::Gnu\*(C'\fR are installed
it supports both history and command completion.
.PP
Once you are on the command line, type \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR to get a one page help
screen and the rest should be self\-explanatory.
.PP
The function call \f(CW\*(C`shell\*(C'\fR takes two optional arguments, one is the
prompt, the second is the default initial command line (the latter
only works if a real ReadLine interface module is installed).
.PP
The most common uses of the interactive modes are
.IP "Searching for authors, bundles, distribution files and modules" 2
.IX Item "Searching for authors, bundles, distribution files and modules"
There are corresponding one-letter commands \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR
for each of the four categories and another, \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR for any of the
mentioned four. Each of the four entities is implemented as a class
with slightly differing methods for displaying an object.
.Sp
Arguments you pass to these commands are either strings exactly matching
the identification string of an object or regular expressions that are
then matched case-insensitively against various attributes of the
objects. The parser recognizes a regular expression only if you
enclose it between two slashes.
.Sp
The principle is that the number of found objects influences how an
item is displayed. If the search finds one item, the result is
displayed with the rather verbose method \f(CW\*(C`as_string\*(C'\fR, but if we find
more than one, we display each object with the terse method
\&\f(CW\*(C`as_glimpse\*(C'\fR.

The examples illustrate several aspects: the first three queries
target modules, authors, or distros directly and yield exactly one
result. The last two use regular expressions and yield several
results. The last one targets all of bundles, modules, authors, and
distros simultaneously. When more than one result is available, they
are printed in one-line format.
.ie n .IP """get""\fR, \f(CW""make""\fR, \f(CW""test""\fR, \f(CW""install""\fR, \f(CW""clean"" modules or distributions" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWget\fR, \f(CWmake\fR, \f(CWtest\fR, \f(CWinstall\fR, \f(CWclean\fR modules or distributions" 2
.IX Item "get, make, test, install, clean modules or distributions"
These commands take any number of arguments and investigate what is
necessary to perform the action. If the argument is a distribution
file name (recognized by embedded slashes), it is processed. If it is
a module, \s-1CPAN\s0 determines the distribution file in which this module
is included and processes that, following any dependencies named in
the module's \s-1META\s0.yml or Makefile.PL (this behavior is controlled by
the configuration parameter \f(CW\*(C`prerequisites_policy\*(C'\fR.)
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR downloads a distribution file and untars or unzips it, \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR
builds it, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR runs the test suite, and \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR installs it.
.Sp
Any \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR are run unconditionally. An
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  install <distribution_file>
.Ve
.Sp
also is run unconditionally. But for
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  install <module>
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 checks if an install is actually needed for it and prints
\&\fImodule up to date\fR in the case that the distribution file containing
the module doesn't need to be updated.
.Sp
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 also keeps track of what it has done within the current session
and doesn't try to build a package a second time regardless if it
succeeded or not. It does not repeat a test run if the test
has been run successfully before. Same for install runs.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`force\*(C'\fR pragma may precede another command (currently: \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR) and executes the command from scratch
and tries to continue in case of some errors. See the section below on
the \f(CW\*(C`force\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`fforce\*(C'\fR pragma.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`notest\*(C'\fR pragma may be used to skip the test part in the build
process.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cpan> notest install Tk
.Ve
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`clean\*(C'\fR command results in a
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  make clean
.Ve
.Sp
being executed within the distribution file's working directory.

.el .IP "\f(CWreadme\fR, \f(CWperldoc\fR, \f(CWlook\fR module or distribution" 2
.IX Item "readme, perldoc, look module or distribution"
\&\f(CW\*(C`readme\*(C'\fR displays the \s-1README\s0 file of the associated distribution.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Look\*(C'\fR gets and untars (if not yet done) the distribution file,
changes to the appropriate directory and opens a subshell process in
that directory. \f(CW\*(C`perldoc\*(C'\fR displays the pod documentation of the
module in html or plain text format.
.ie n .IP """ls"" author" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWls\fR author" 2
.IX Item "ls author"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP """ls"" globbing_expression" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWls\fR globbing_expression" 2
.IX Item "ls globbing_expression"
.PD
The first form lists all distribution files in and below an author's
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 directory as they are stored in the \s-1CHECKUMS\s0 files distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN\s0. The listing goes recursive into all subdirectories.
.Sp
The second form allows to limit or expand the output with shell
globbing as in the following examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&      ls JV/make*
\&      ls GSAR/*make*
\&      ls */*make*
.Ve
.Sp
The last example is very slow and outputs extra progress indicators
that break the alignment of the result.
.Sp
Note that globbing only lists directories explicitly asked for, for
example FOO/* will not list FOO/bar/Acme\-Sthg\-n.nn.tar.gz. This may be
regarded as a bug and may be changed in future versions.
.ie n .IP """failed""" 2
.el .IP "\f(CWfailed\fR" 2
.IX Item "failed"
The \f(CW\*(C`failed\*(C'\fR command reports all distributions that failed on one of
\&\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR for some reason in the currently
running shell session.
.IP "Persistence between sessions" 2
.IX Item "Persistence between sessions"
If the \f(CW\*(C`YAML\*(C'\fR or the \f(CW\*(C`YAML::Syck\*(C'\fR module is installed a record of
the internal state of all modules is written to disk after each step.
The files contain a signature of the currently running perl version
for later perusal.
.Sp
If the configurations variable \f(CW\*(C`build_dir_reuse\*(C'\fR is set to a true
value, then \s-1CPAN\s0.pm reads the collected \s-1YAML\s0 files. If the stored
signature matches the currently running perl the stored state is
loaded into memory such that effectively persistence between sessions
is established.
.ie n .IP "The ""force""\fR and the \f(CW""fforce"" pragma" 2
.el .IP "The \f(CWforce\fR and the \f(CWfforce\fR pragma" 2
.IX Item "The force and the fforce pragma"
To speed things up in complex installation scenarios, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm keeps
track of what it has already done and refuses to do some things a
second time. A \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, a \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, and an \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR are not repeated.
A \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR is only repeated if the previous test was unsuccessful. The
diagnostic message when \s-1CPAN\s0.pm refuses to do something a second time
is one of \fIHas already been \fR\f(CW\*(C`unwrapped|made|tested successfully\*(C'\fR or
something similar. Another situation where \s-1CPAN\s0 refuses to act is an
\&\f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR if the according \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR was not successful.
.Sp
In all these cases, the user can override the goatish behaviour by
prepending the command with the word force, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  cpan> force get Foo
\&  cpan> force make AUTHOR/Bar-3.14.tar.gz
\&  cpan> force test Baz
\&  cpan> force install Acme::Meta
.Ve
.Sp
Each \fIforced\fR command is executed with the according part of its
memory erased.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`fforce\*(C'\fR pragma is a variant that emulates a \f(CW\*(C`force get\*(C'\fR which
erases the entire memory followed by the action specified, effectively
restarting the whole get/make/test/install procedure from scratch.
.IP "Lockfile" 2
.IX Item "Lockfile"
Interactive sessions maintain a lockfile, per default \f(CW\*(C`~/.cpan/.lock\*(C'\fR.
Batch jobs can run without a lockfile and do not disturb each other.
.Sp
The shell offers to run in \fIdegraded mode\fR when another process is
holding the lockfile. This is an experimental feature that is not yet
tested very well. This second shell then does not write the history
file, does not use the metadata file and has a different prompt.
.IP "Signals" 2
.IX Item "Signals"
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm installs signal handlers for \s-1SIGINT\s0 and \s-1SIGTERM\s0. While you are
in the cpan-shell it is intended that you can press \f(CW\*(C`^C\*(C'\fR anytime and
return to the cpan-shell prompt. A \s-1SIGTERM\s0 will cause the cpan-shell
to clean up and leave the shell loop. You can emulate the effect of a
\&\s-1SIGTERM\s0 by sending two consecutive SIGINTs, which usually means by
pressing \f(CW\*(C`^C\*(C'\fR twice.
.Sp
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm ignores a \s-1SIGPIPE\s0. If the user sets \f(CW\*(C`inactivity_timeout\*(C'\fR, a
\&\s-1SIGALRM\s0 is used during the run of the \f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`perl
Build.PL\*(C'\fR subprocess.
.Sh "CPAN::Shell"
.IX Subsection "CPAN::Shell"
The commands that are available in the shell interface are methods in
the package CPAN::Shell. If you enter the shell command, all your
input is split by the \fIText::ParseWords::shellwords()\fR routine which
acts like most shells do. The first word is being interpreted as the
method to be called and the rest of the words are treated as arguments
to this method. Continuation lines are supported if a line ends with a
literal backslash.
.Sh "autobundle"
.IX Subsection "autobundle"
\&\f(CW\*(C`autobundle\*(C'\fR writes a bundle file into the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$CPAN::Config\->{cpan_home}/Bundle\*(C'\fR directory. The file contains
a list of all modules that are both available from \s-1CPAN\s0 and currently
installed within \f(CW@INC\fR. The name of the bundle file is based on the
current date and a counter.
.Sh "hosts"
.IX Subsection "hosts"
Note: this feature is still in alpha state and may change in future
versions of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm
.PP
This commands provides a statistical overview over recent download
activities. The data for this is collected in the \s-1YAML\s0 file
\&\f(CW\*(C`FTPstats.yml\*(C'\fR in your \f(CW\*(C`cpan_home\*(C'\fR directory. If no \s-1YAML\s0 module is
configured or \s-1YAML\s0 not installed, then no stats are provided.
.Sh "mkmyconfig"
.IX Subsection "mkmyconfig"
\&\fImkmyconfig()\fR writes your own CPAN::MyConfig file into your ~/.cpan/
directory so that you can save your own preferences instead of the
system wide ones.
.Sh "recent ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***"
.IX Subsection "recent ***EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND***"
The \f(CW\*(C`recent\*(C'\fR command downloads a list of recent uploads to \s-1CPAN\s0 and
displays them \fIslowly\fR. While the command is running \f(CW$SIG\fR{\s-1INT\s0} is
defined to mean that the loop shall be left after having displayed the
current item.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: This command requires XML::LibXML installed.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: This whole command currently is just a hack and will
probably change in future versions of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm but the general
approach will likely stay.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: See also smoke
.Sh "recompile"
.IX Subsection "recompile"
\&\fIrecompile()\fR is a very special command in that it takes no argument and
runs the make/test/install cycle with brute force over all installed
dynamically loadable extensions (aka \s-1XS\s0 modules) with 'force' in
effect. The primary purpose of this command is to finish a network
installation. Imagine, you have a common source tree for two different
architectures. You decide to do a completely independent fresh
installation. You start on one architecture with the help of a Bundle
file produced earlier. \s-1CPAN\s0 installs the whole Bundle for you, but
when you try to repeat the job on the second architecture, \s-1CPAN\s0
responds with a \f(CW"Foo up to date"\fR message for all modules. So you
invoke \s-1CPAN\s0's recompile on the second architecture and you're done.
.PP
Another popular use for \f(CW\*(C`recompile\*(C'\fR is to act as a rescue in case your
perl breaks binary compatibility. If one of the modules that \s-1CPAN\s0 uses
is in turn depending on binary compatibility (so you cannot run \s-1CPAN\s0
commands), then you should try the CPAN::Nox module for recovery.
.Sh "report Bundle|Distribution|Module"
.IX Subsection "report Bundle|Distribution|Module"
The \f(CW\*(C`report\*(C'\fR command temporarily turns on the \f(CW\*(C`test_report\*(C'\fR config

.el .Sh "The four \f(CWCPAN::*\fP Classes: Author, Bundle, Module, Distribution"
.IX Subsection "The four CPAN::* Classes: Author, Bundle, Module, Distribution"
Although it may be considered internal, the class hierarchy does matter
for both users and programmer. \s-1CPAN\s0.pm deals with above mentioned four
classes, and all those classes share a set of methods. A classical
single polymorphism is in effect. A metaclass object registers all
objects of all kinds and indexes them with a string. The strings
referencing objects have a separated namespace (well, not completely
separated):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&         Namespace                         Class
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   words containing a "/" (slash)      Distribution
\&    words starting with Bundle::          Bundle
\&          everything else            Module or Author
.Ve
.PP
Modules know their associated Distribution objects. They always refer
to the most recent official release. Developers may mark their releases
as unstable development versions (by inserting an underbar into the
module version number which will also be reflected in the distribution
name when you run 'make dist'), so the really hottest and newest
distribution is not always the default.  If a module Foo circulates
on \s-1CPAN\s0 in both version 1.23 and 1.23_90, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm offers a convenient
way to install version 1.23 by saying
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    install Foo
.Ve
.PP
This would install the complete distribution file (say
BAR/Foo\-1.23.tar.gz) with all accompanying material. But if you would
like to install version 1.23_90, you need to know where the
distribution file resides on \s-1CPAN\s0 relative to the authors/id/
directory. If the author is \s-1BAR\s0, this might be BAR/Foo\-1.23_90.tar.gz;
so you would have to say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    install BAR/Foo-1.23_90.tar.gz
.Ve
.PP
The first example will be driven by an object of the class
CPAN::Module, the second by an object of class CPAN::Distribution.
.Sh "Integrating local directories"
.IX Subsection "Integrating local directories"
Note: this feature is still in alpha state and may change in future
versions of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm
.PP
Distribution objects are normally distributions from the \s-1CPAN\s0, but
there is a slightly degenerate case for Distribution objects, too, of
projects held on the local disk. These distribution objects have the
same name as the local directory and end with a dot. A dot by itself
is also allowed for the current directory at the time \s-1CPAN\s0.pm was
used. All actions such as \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR are applied
directly to that directory. This gives the command \f(CW\*(C`cpan .\*(C'\fR an
interesting touch: while the normal mantra of installing a \s-1CPAN\s0 module
without \s-1CPAN\s0.pm is one of
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    perl Makefile.PL                 perl Build.PL
\&           ( go and get prerequisites )
\&    make                             ./Build
\&    make test                        ./Build test
\&    make install                     ./Build install
.Ve
.PP
the command \f(CW\*(C`cpan .\*(C'\fR does all of this at once. It figures out which
of the two mantras is appropriate, fetches and installs all
prerequisites, cares for them recursively and finally finishes the
installation of the module in the current directory, be it a \s-1CPAN\s0
module or not.
.PP
The typical usage case is for private modules or working copies of
projects from remote repositories on the local disk.
.Sh "Redirection"
.IX Subsection "Redirection"
The usual shell redirection symbols \f(CW\*(C` | \*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR are recognized
by the cpan shell when surrounded by whitespace. So piping into a
pager and redirecting output into a file works quite similar to any
shell.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
When the \s-1CPAN\s0 module is used for the first time, a configuration
dialog tries to determine a couple of site specific options. The
result of the dialog is stored in a hash reference \f(CW $CPAN::Config \fR
in a file CPAN/Config.pm.
.PP
The default values defined in the CPAN/Config.pm file can be
overridden in a user specific file: CPAN/MyConfig.pm. Such a file is
best placed in \f(CW$HOME\fR/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm, because \f(CW$HOME\fR/.cpan is
added to the search path of the \s-1CPAN\s0 module before the \fIuse()\fR or
\&\fIrequire()\fR statements. The mkmyconfig command writes this file for you.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`o conf\*(C'\fR command has various bells and whistles:
.IP "completion support" 4
.IX Item "completion support"
If you have a ReadLine module installed, you can hit \s-1TAB\s0 at any point
of the commandline and \f(CW\*(C`o conf\*(C'\fR will offer you completion for the
built-in subcommands and/or config variable names.
.IP "displaying some help: o conf help" 4
.IX Item "displaying some help: o conf help"
Displays a short help
.IP "displaying current values: o conf [\s-1KEY\s0]" 4
.IX Item "displaying current values: o conf [KEY]"
Displays the current value(s) for this config variable. Without \s-1KEY\s0
displays all subcommands and config variables.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf shell
.Ve
.Sp
If \s-1KEY\s0 starts and ends with a slash the string in between is
interpreted as a regular expression and only keys matching this regex
are displayed
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf /color/
.Ve
.IP "changing of scalar values: o conf \s-1KEY\s0 \s-1VALUE\s0" 4
.IX Item "changing of scalar values: o conf KEY VALUE"
Sets the config variable \s-1KEY\s0 to \s-1VALUE\s0. The empty string can be
specified as usual in shells, with \f(CW''\fR or \f(CW""\fR
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf wget /usr/bin/wget
.Ve
.IP "changing of list values: o conf \s-1KEY\s0 SHIFT|UNSHIFT|PUSH|POP|SPLICE|LIST" 4
.IX Item "changing of list values: o conf KEY SHIFT|UNSHIFT|PUSH|POP|SPLICE|LIST"
If a config variable name ends with \f(CW\*(C`list\*(C'\fR, it is a list. \f(CW\*(C`o conf
KEY shift\*(C'\fR removes the first element of the list, \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEY pop\*(C'\fR
removes the last element of the list. \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEYS unshift LIST\*(C'\fR
prepends a list of values to the list, \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEYS push LIST\*(C'\fR
appends a list of valued to the list.
.Sp
Likewise, \f(CW\*(C`o conf KEY splice LIST\*(C'\fR passes the \s-1LIST\s0 to the according
splice command.
.Sp
Finally, any other list of arguments is taken as a new list value for
the \s-1KEY\s0 variable discarding the previous value.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  o conf urllist unshift http://cpan.dev.local/CPAN
\&  o conf urllist splice 3 1
\&  o conf urllist http://cpan1.local http://cpan2.local ftp://ftp.perl.org
.Ve
.IP "reverting to saved: o conf defaults" 4
.IX Item "reverting to saved: o conf defaults"
Reverts all config variables to the state in the saved config file.
.IP "saving the config: o conf commit" 4
.IX Item "saving the config: o conf commit"
Saves all config variables to the current config file (CPAN/Config.pm
or CPAN/MyConfig.pm that was loaded at start).
.PP
The configuration dialog can be started any time later again by
issuing the command \f(CW\*(C` o conf init \*(C'\fR in the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell. A subset of
the configuration dialog can be run by issuing \f(CW\*(C`o conf init WORD\*(C'\fR
where \s-1WORD\s0 is any valid config variable or a regular expression.

The \f(CW\*(C`urllist\*(C'\fR parameter of the configuration table contains a list of
URLs that are to be used for downloading. If the list contains any
\&\f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR URLs, \s-1CPAN\s0 always tries to get files from there first. This
feature is disabled for index files. So the recommendation for the
owner of a CD-ROM with \s-1CPAN\s0 contents is: include your local, possibly
outdated CD-ROM as a \f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR \s-1URL\s0 at the end of urllist, e.g.
.PP
.Vb 1

that come at the beginning of urllist. It will later check for each
module if there is a local copy of the most recent version.
.PP
Another peculiarity of urllist is that the site that we could
successfully fetch the last file from automatically gets a preference
token and is tried as the first site for the next request. So if you
add a new site at runtime it may happen that the previously preferred
site will be tried another time. This means that if you want to disallow
a site for the next transfer, it must be explicitly removed from
urllist.

(\fBNote:\fR This feature has been introduced in \s-1CPAN\s0.pm 1.8854 and is
still considered beta quality)
.PP
Distributions on the \s-1CPAN\s0 usually behave according to what we call the
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 mantra. Or since the event of Module::Build we should talk about
two mantras:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    perl Makefile.PL     perl Build.PL

.Ve
.PP
But some modules cannot be built with this mantra. They try to get
some extra data from the user via the environment, extra arguments or
interactively thus disturbing the installation of large bundles like
Phalanx100 or modules with many dependencies like Plagger.
.PP
The distroprefs system of \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR addresses this problem by
allowing the user to specify extra informations and recipes in \s-1YAML\s0

set environment variables

See the \s-1YAML\s0 and Data::Dumper files that come with the \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR
distribution in the \f(CW\*(C`distroprefs/\*(C'\fR directory for examples.
.Sh "Filenames"
.IX Subsection "Filenames"
The \s-1YAML\s0 files themselves must have the \f(CW\*(C`.yml\*(C'\fR extension, all other
files are ignored (for two exceptions see \fIFallback Data::Dumper and
Storable\fR below). The containing directory can be specified in
\&\f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir\*(C'\fR config variable. Try \f(CW\*(C`o conf init
prefs_dir\*(C'\fR in the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell to set and activate the distroprefs
system.
.PP
Every \s-1YAML\s0 file may contain arbitrary documents according to the \s-1YAML\s0
specification and every single document is treated as an entity that
can specify the treatment of a single distribution.
.PP
The names of the files can be picked freely, \f(CW\*(C`CPAN.pm\*(C'\fR always reads
all files (in alphabetical order) and takes the key \f(CW\*(C`match\*(C'\fR (see
below in \fILanguage Specs\fR) as a hashref containing match criteria
that determine if the current distribution matches the \s-1YAML\s0 document
or not.
.Sh "Fallback Data::Dumper and Storable"
.IX Subsection "Fallback Data::Dumper and Storable"
If neither your configured \f(CW\*(C`yaml_module\*(C'\fR nor \s-1YAML\s0.pm is installed
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm falls back to using Data::Dumper and Storable and looks for
files with the extensions \f(CW\*(C`.dd\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.st\*(C'\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir\*(C'\fR
directory. These files are expected to contain one or more hashrefs.
For Data::Dumper generated files, this is expected to be done with by
defining \f(CW$VAR1\fR, \f(CW$VAR2\fR, etc. The \s-1YAML\s0 shell would produce these
with the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ysh < somefile.yml > somefile.dd
.Ve
.PP
For Storable files the rule is that they must be constructed such that
\&\f(CW\*(C`Storable::retrieve(file)\*(C'\fR returns an array reference and the array
elements represent one distropref object each. The conversion from
\&\s-1YAML\s0 would look like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    perl -MYAML=LoadFile -MStorable=nstore -e '
\&        @y=LoadFile(shift);
\&        nstore(\e@y, shift)' somefile.yml somefile.st
.Ve
.PP
In bootstrapping situations it is usually sufficient to translate only
a few \s-1YAML\s0 files to Data::Dumper for the crucial modules like
\&\f(CW\*(C`YAML::Syck\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`YAML.pm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Expect.pm\*(C'\fR. If you prefer Storable
over Data::Dumper, remember to pull out a Storable version that writes
an older format than all the other Storable versions that will need to
read them.
.Sh "Blueprint"

targeted at a specific \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution or installation.
.Sp
The corresponding values are interpreted as regular expressions. The

If more than one restriction of \f(CW\*(C`module\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`distribution\*(C'\fR, etc. is

Extended \f(CW\*(C`expect\*(C'\fR. This is a hash reference with four allowed keys,

\&\f(CW\*(C`mode\*(C'\fR may have the values \f(CW\*(C`deterministic\*(C'\fR for the case where all
questions come in the order written down and \f(CW\*(C`anyorder\*(C'\fR for the case
where the questions may come in any order. The default mode is
\&\f(CW\*(C`deterministic\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`timeout\*(C'\fR denotes a timeout in seconds. Floating point timeouts are
\&\s-1OK\s0. In the case of a \f(CW\*(C`mode=deterministic\*(C'\fR the timeout denotes the
timeout per question, in the case of \f(CW\*(C`mode=anyorder\*(C'\fR it denotes the
timeout per byte received from the stream or questions.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`talk\*(C'\fR is a reference to an array that contains alternating questions
and answers. Questions are regular expressions and answers are literal
strings. The Expect module will then watch the stream coming from the
execution of the external program (\f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`perl
Build.PL\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR, etc.).
.Sp
In the case of \f(CW\*(C`mode=deterministic\*(C'\fR the \s-1CPAN\s0.pm will inject the
according answer as soon as the stream matches the regular expression.
.Sp
In the case of \f(CW\*(C`mode=anyorder\*(C'\fR \s-1CPAN\s0.pm will answer a question as soon
as the timeout is reached for the next byte in the input stream. In
this mode you can use the \f(CW\*(C`reuse\*(C'\fR parameter to decide what shall
happen with a question-answer pair after it has been used. In the
default case (reuse=0) it is removed from the array, so it cannot be
used again accidentally. In this case, if you want to answer the
question \f(CW\*(C`Do you really want to do that\*(C'\fR several times, then it must
be included in the array at least as often as you want this answer to
be given. Setting the parameter \f(CW\*(C`reuse\*(C'\fR to 1 makes this repetition
unnecessary.

If you do not enter the shell, the available shell commands are both
available as methods (\f(CW\*(C`CPAN::Shell\->install(...)\*(C'\fR) and as
functions in the calling package (\f(CW\*(C`install(...)\*(C'\fR).  Before calling low-level
commands it makes sense to initialize components of \s-1CPAN\s0 you need, e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  CPAN::HandleConfig->load;
\&  CPAN::Shell::setup_output;
\&  CPAN::Index->reload;
.Ve
.PP
High-level commands do such initializations automatically.
.PP
There's currently only one class that has a stable interface \-
CPAN::Shell. All commands that are available in the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell are
methods of the class CPAN::Shell. Each of the commands that produce
listings of modules (\f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`autobundle\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`u\*(C'\fR) also return a list of
the IDs of all modules within the list.
.IP "expand($type,@things)" 2
.IX Item "expand($type,@things)"
The IDs of all objects available within a program are strings that can
be expanded to the corresponding real objects with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`CPAN::Shell\->expand("Module",@things)\*(C'\fR method. Expand returns a
list of CPAN::Module objects according to the \f(CW@things\fR arguments
given. In scalar context it only returns the first element of the
list.
.IP "expandany(@things)" 2
.IX Item "expandany(@things)"
Like expand, but returns objects of the appropriate type, i.e.
CPAN::Bundle objects for bundles, CPAN::Module objects for modules and
CPAN::Distribution objects for distributions. Note: it does not expand

.Sp
Or if you want to write a cronjob to watch The \s-1CPAN\s0, you could list
all modules that need updating. First a quick and dirty way:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl -e 'use CPAN; CPAN::Shell->r;'
.Ve
.Sp
If you don't want to get any output in the case that all modules are
up to date, you can parse the output of above command for the regular
expression //modules are up to date// and decide to mail the output
only if it doesn't match. Ick?
.Sp
If you prefer to do it more in a programmer style in one single
process, maybe something like this suits you better:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  # list all modules on my disk that have newer versions on CPAN
\&  for $mod (CPAN::Shell->expand("Module","/./")) {
\&    next unless $mod->inst_file;
\&    next if $mod->uptodate;
\&    printf "Module %s is installed as %s, could be updated to %s from CPAN\en",
\&        $mod->id, $mod->inst_version, $mod->cpan_version;
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
If that gives you too much output every day, you maybe only want to
watch for three modules. You can write
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  for $mod (CPAN::Shell->expand("Module","/Apache|LWP|CGI/")) {
.Ve
.Sp
as the first line instead. Or you can combine some of the above
tricks:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  # watch only for a new mod_perl module
\&  $mod = CPAN::Shell->expand("Module","mod_perl");
\&  exit if $mod->uptodate;
\&  # new mod_perl arrived, let me know all update recommendations
\&  CPAN::Shell->r;

.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::get()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::get()"
Downloads the distribution from \s-1CPAN\s0 and unpacks it. Does nothing if
the distribution has already been downloaded and unpacked within the
current session.
.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::install()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::install()"
Changes to the directory where the distribution has been unpacked and
runs the external command \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR there. If \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR has not
yet been run, it will be run first. A \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR will be issued in
any case and if this fails, the install will be canceled. The
cancellation can be avoided by letting \f(CW\*(C`force\*(C'\fR run the \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR for
you.
.Sp
This install method has only the power to install the distribution if
there are no dependencies in the way. To install an object and all of
its dependencies, use CPAN::Shell\->install.
.Sp
Note that \fIinstall()\fR gives no meaningful return value. See \fIuptodate()\fR.
.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::install_tested()\fR" 4

.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::prefs()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::prefs()"
Returns the hash reference from the first matching \s-1YAML\s0 file that the
user has deposited in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir/\*(C'\fR directory. The first
succeeding match wins. The files in the \f(CW\*(C`prefs_dir/\*(C'\fR are processed
alphabetically and the canonical distroname (e.g.
AUTHOR/Foo\-Bar\-3.14.tar.gz) is matched against the regular expressions
stored in the \f(CW$root\fR\->{match}{distribution} attribute value.
Additionally all module names contained in a distribution are matched
agains the regular expressions in the \f(CW$root\fR\->{match}{module} attribute
value. The two match values are ANDed together. Each of the two
attributes are optional.
.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::prereq_pm()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::prereq_pm()"
Returns the hash reference that has been announced by a distribution
as the the \f(CW\*(C`requires\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`build_requires\*(C'\fR elements. These can be
declared either by the \f(CW\*(C`META.yml\*(C'\fR (if authoritative) or can be
deposited after the run of \f(CW\*(C`Build.PL\*(C'\fR in the file \f(CW\*(C`./_build/prereqs\*(C'\fR

.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::read_yaml()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Distribution::read_yaml()"
Returns the content of the \s-1META\s0.yml of this distro as a hashref. Note:
works only after an attempt has been made to \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR the distribution.
Returns undef otherwise. Also returns undef if the content of \s-1META\s0.yml
is not authoritative. (The rules about what exactly makes the content
authoritative are still in flux.)
.IP "\fICPAN::Distribution::test()\fR" 4

.IP "\fICPAN::InfoObj::dump()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::InfoObj::dump()"
CPAN::Author, CPAN::Bundle, CPAN::Module, and CPAN::Distribution
inherit this method. It prints the data structure associated with an

internal and thus subject to change without notice.
.IP "\fICPAN::Module::as_glimpse()\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPAN::Module::as_glimpse()"
Returns a one-line description of the module in four columns: The
first column contains the word \f(CW\*(C`Module\*(C'\fR, the second column consists
of one character: an equals sign if this module is already installed
and uptodate, a less-than sign if this module is installed but can be
upgraded, and a space if the module is not installed. The third column
is the name of the module and the fourth column gives maintainer or

.Sh "Cache Manager"
.IX Subsection "Cache Manager"
Currently the cache manager only keeps track of the build directory
($CPAN::Config\->{build_dir}). It is a simple \s-1FIFO\s0 mechanism that
deletes complete directories below \f(CW\*(C`build_dir\*(C'\fR as soon as the size of
all directories there gets bigger than \f(CW$CPAN::Config\fR\->{build_cache}
(in \s-1MB\s0). The contents of this cache may be used for later
re-installations that you intend to do manually, but will never be
trusted by \s-1CPAN\s0 itself. This is due to the fact that the user might
use these directories for building modules on different architectures.
.PP
There is another directory ($CPAN::Config\->{keep_source_where}) where
the original distribution files are kept. This directory is not
covered by the cache manager and must be controlled by the user. If
you choose to have the same directory as build_dir and as
keep_source_where directory, then your sources will be deleted with
the same fifo mechanism.
.Sh "Bundles"
.IX Subsection "Bundles"
A bundle is just a perl module in the namespace Bundle:: that does not
define any functions or methods. It usually only contains documentation.
.PP
It starts like a perl module with a package declaration and a \f(CW$VERSION\fR
variable. After that the pod section looks like any other pod with the
only difference being that \fIone special pod section\fR exists starting with
(verbatim):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    =head1 CONTENTS
.Ve
.PP
In this pod section each line obeys the format
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        Module_Name [Version_String] [- optional text]
.Ve
.PP
The only required part is the first field, the name of a module
(e.g. Foo::Bar, ie. \fInot\fR the name of the distribution file). The rest
of the line is optional. The comment part is delimited by a dash just
as in the man page header.
.PP
The distribution of a bundle should follow the same convention as
other distributions.
.PP
Bundles are treated specially in the \s-1CPAN\s0 package. If you say 'install
Bundle::Tkkit' (assuming such a bundle exists), \s-1CPAN\s0 will install all
the modules in the \s-1CONTENTS\s0 section of the pod. You can install your
own Bundles locally by placing a conformant Bundle file somewhere into
your \f(CW@INC\fR path. The \fIautobundle()\fR command which is available in the
shell interface does that for you by including all currently installed
modules in a snapshot bundle file.
.SH "PREREQUISITES"
.IX Header "PREREQUISITES"
If you have a local mirror of \s-1CPAN\s0 and can access all files with
\&\*(L"file:\*(R" URLs, then you only need a perl better than perl5.003 to run
this module. Otherwise Net::FTP is strongly recommended. \s-1LWP\s0 may be
required for non-UNIX systems or if your nearest \s-1CPAN\s0 site is
associated with a \s-1URL\s0 that is not \f(CW\*(C`ftp:\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If you have neither Net::FTP nor \s-1LWP\s0, there is a fallback mechanism
implemented for an external ftp command or for an external lynx
command.
.SH "UTILITIES"
.IX Header "UTILITIES"
.Sh "Finding packages and \s-1VERSION\s0"
.IX Subsection "Finding packages and VERSION"
This module presumes that all packages on \s-1CPAN\s0
.IP "\(bu" 2
declare their \f(CW$VERSION\fR variable in an easy to parse manner. This
prerequisite can hardly be relaxed because it consumes far too much
memory to load all packages into the running program just to determine
the \f(CW$VERSION\fR variable. Currently all programs that are dealing with
version use something like this
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le \e
\&        'print MM->parse_version(shift)' filename
.Ve
.Sp
If you are author of a package and wonder if your \f(CW$VERSION\fR can be
parsed, please try the above method.
.IP "\(bu" 2
come as compressed or gzipped tarfiles or as zip files and contain a
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Build.PL\*(C'\fR (well, we try to handle a bit more, but
without much enthusiasm).
.Sh "Debugging"
.IX Subsection "Debugging"
The debugging of this module is a bit complex, because we have
interferences of the software producing the indices on \s-1CPAN\s0, of the
mirroring process on \s-1CPAN\s0, of packaging, of configuration, of
synchronicity, and of bugs within \s-1CPAN\s0.pm.
.PP
For debugging the code of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm itself in interactive mode some more
or less useful debugging aid can be turned on for most packages within
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm with one of
.IP "o debug package..." 2
.IX Item "debug package..."
sets debug mode for packages.
.IP "o debug \-package..." 2
.IX Item "debug -package..."
unsets debug mode for packages.
.IP "o debug all" 2
.IX Item "debug all"
turns debugging on for all packages.
.IP "o debug number" 2
.IX Item "debug number"
.PP
which sets the debugging packages directly. Note that \f(CW\*(C`o debug 0\*(C'\fR
turns debugging off.
.PP
What seems quite a successful strategy is the combination of \f(CW\*(C`reload
cpan\*(C'\fR and the debugging switches. Add a new debug statement while
running in the shell and then issue a \f(CW\*(C`reload cpan\*(C'\fR and see the new
debugging messages immediately without losing the current context.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`o debug\*(C'\fR without an argument lists the valid package names and the
current set of packages in debugging mode. \f(CW\*(C`o debug\*(C'\fR has built-in
completion support.
.PP
For debugging of \s-1CPAN\s0 data there is the \f(CW\*(C`dump\*(C'\fR command which takes
the same arguments as make/test/install and outputs each object's
Data::Dumper dump. If an argument looks like a perl variable and
contains one of \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR, it is \fIeval()\fRed and fed to
Data::Dumper directly.
.Sh "Floppy, Zip, Offline Mode"
.IX Subsection "Floppy, Zip, Offline Mode"
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm works nicely without network too. If you maintain machines
that are not networked at all, you should consider working with file:
URLs. Of course, you have to collect your modules somewhere first. So
you might use \s-1CPAN\s0.pm to put together all you need on a networked
machine. Then copy the \f(CW$CPAN::Config\fR\->{keep_source_where} (but not
\&\f(CW$CPAN::Config\fR\->{build_dir}) directory on a floppy. This floppy is kind
of a personal \s-1CPAN\s0. \s-1CPAN\s0.pm on the non-networked machines works nicely
with this floppy. See also below the paragraph about CD-ROM support.

Returns true if the module is installed. Used to load all modules into

\&\f(CW\*(C`dontload_list\*(C'\fR can be used to intercept the \f(CW\*(C`has_inst()\*(C'\fR call such
that an optional module is not loaded despite being available. For
example the following command will prevent that \f(CW\*(C`YAML.pm\*(C'\fR is being

.SH "SECURITY"
.IX Header "SECURITY"
There's no strong security layer in \s-1CPAN\s0.pm. \s-1CPAN\s0.pm helps you to
install foreign, unmasked, unsigned code on your machine. We compare
to a checksum that comes from the net just as the distribution file
itself. But we try to make it easy to add security on demand:
.Sh "Cryptographically signed modules"
.IX Subsection "Cryptographically signed modules"
Since release 1.77 \s-1CPAN\s0.pm has been able to verify cryptographically
signed module distributions using Module::Signature.  The \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
can be signed by their authors, thus giving more security.  The simple
unsigned \s-1MD5\s0 checksums that were used before by \s-1CPAN\s0 protect mainly
against accidental file corruption.
.PP
You will need to have Module::Signature installed, which in turn
requires that you have at least one of Crypt::OpenPGP module or the
command-line \fIgpg\fR tool installed.
.PP
You will also need to be able to connect over the Internet to the public
keyservers, like pgp.mit.edu, and their port 11731 (the \s-1HKP\s0 protocol).
.PP
The configuration parameter check_sigs is there to turn signature
checking on or off.
.SH "EXPORT"
.IX Header "EXPORT"
Most functions in package \s-1CPAN\s0 are exported per default. The reason
for this is that the primary use is intended for the cpan shell or for
one\-liners.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
When the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell enters a subshell via the look command, it sets
the environment \s-1CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL\s0 to 1 or increments it if it is
already set.
.PP
When \s-1CPAN\s0 runs, it sets the environment variable \s-1PERL5_CPAN_IS_RUNNING\s0
to the \s-1ID\s0 of the running process. It also sets
\&\s-1PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING\s0 to prevent runaway processes which could
happen with older versions of Module::Install.
.PP
When running \f(CW\*(C`perl Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR, the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERL5_CPAN_IS_EXECUTING\*(C'\fR is set to the full path of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile.PL\*(C'\fR that is being executed. This prevents runaway processes
with newer versions of Module::Install.
.PP
When the config variable ftp_passive is set, all downloads will be run
with the environment variable \s-1FTP_PASSIVE\s0 set to this value. This is
in general a good idea as it influences both Net::FTP and \s-1LWP\s0 based
connections. The same effect can be achieved by starting the cpan
shell with this environment variable set. For Net::FTP alone, one can
also always set passive mode by running libnetcfg.
.SH "POPULATE AN INSTALLATION WITH LOTS OF MODULES"
.IX Header "POPULATE AN INSTALLATION WITH LOTS OF MODULES"
Populating a freshly installed perl with my favorite modules is pretty
easy if you maintain a private bundle definition file. To get a useful
blueprint of a bundle definition file, the command autobundle can be used
on the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell command line. This command writes a bundle definition
file for all modules that are installed for the currently running perl
interpreter. It's recommended to run this command only once and from then
on maintain the file manually under a private name, say
Bundle/my_bundle.pm. With a clever bundle file you can then simply say
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cpan> install Bundle::my_bundle
.Ve
.PP
then answer a few questions and then go out for a coffee.
.PP
Maintaining a bundle definition file means keeping track of two
things: dependencies and interactivity. \s-1CPAN\s0.pm sometimes fails on
calculating dependencies because not all modules define all MakeMaker
attributes correctly, so a bundle definition file should specify
prerequisites as early as possible. On the other hand, it's a bit
annoying that many distributions need some interactive configuring. So
what I try to accomplish in my private bundle file is to have the
packages that need to be configured early in the file and the gentle

.SH "WORKING WITH CPAN.pm BEHIND FIREWALLS"
.IX Header "WORKING WITH CPAN.pm BEHIND FIREWALLS"
Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing the following paragraphs about
the interaction between perl, and various firewall configurations. For
further information on firewalls, it is recommended to consult the
documentation that comes with the ncftp program. If you are unable to
go through the firewall with a simple Perl setup, it is very likely
that you can configure ncftp so that it works for your firewall.
.Sh "Three basic types of firewalls"
.IX Subsection "Three basic types of firewalls"
Firewalls can be categorized into three basic types.
.IP "http firewall" 4
.IX Item "http firewall"
This is where the firewall machine runs a web server and to access the
outside world you must do it via the web server. If you set environment
variables like http_proxy or ftp_proxy to a values beginning with http://
or in your web browser you have to set proxy information then you know
you are running an http firewall.
.Sp
To access servers outside these types of firewalls with perl (even for
ftp) you will need to use \s-1LWP\s0.
.IP "ftp firewall" 4
.IX Item "ftp firewall"
This where the firewall machine runs an ftp server. This kind of
firewall will only let you access ftp servers outside the firewall.
This is usually done by connecting to the firewall with ftp, then
entering a username like \*(L"user@outside.host.com\*(R"
.Sp
To access servers outside these type of firewalls with perl you
will need to use Net::FTP.
.IP "One way visibility" 4
.IX Item "One way visibility"
I say one way visibility as these firewalls try to make themselves look
invisible to the users inside the firewall. An \s-1FTP\s0 data connection is
normally created by sending the remote server your \s-1IP\s0 address and then
listening for the connection. But the remote server will not be able to
connect to you because of the firewall. So for these types of firewall
\&\s-1FTP\s0 connections need to be done in a passive mode.
.Sp
There are two that I can think off.
.RS 4
.IP "\s-1SOCKS\s0" 4
.IX Item "SOCKS"
If you are using a \s-1SOCKS\s0 firewall you will need to compile perl and link
it with the \s-1SOCKS\s0 library, this is what is normally called a 'socksified'
perl. With this executable you will be able to connect to servers outside
the firewall as if it is not there.
.IP "\s-1IP\s0 Masquerade" 4
.IX Item "IP Masquerade"
This is the firewall implemented in the Linux kernel, it allows you to
hide a complete network behind one \s-1IP\s0 address. With this firewall no
special compiling is needed as you can access hosts directly.
.Sp
For accessing ftp servers behind such firewalls you usually need to
set the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`FTP_PASSIVE\*(C'\fR or the config variable
ftp_passive to a true value.

.Sh "Configuring lynx or ncftp for going through a firewall"
.IX Subsection "Configuring lynx or ncftp for going through a firewall"
If you can go through your firewall with e.g. lynx, presumably with a
command such as
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    /usr/local/bin/lynx -pscott:tiger
.Ve
.PP
then you would configure \s-1CPAN\s0.pm with the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    o conf lynx "/usr/local/bin/lynx -pscott:tiger"
.Ve
.PP
That's all. Similarly for ncftp or ftp, you would configure something
like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    o conf ncftp "/usr/bin/ncftp -f /home/scott/ncftplogin.cfg"
.Ve
.PP
Your mileage may vary...
.SH "FAQ"
.IX Header "FAQ"
.IP "1)" 4
I installed a new version of module X but \s-1CPAN\s0 keeps saying,
I have the old version installed
.Sp
Most probably you \fBdo\fR have the old version installed. This can
happen if a module installs itself into a different directory in the
\&\f(CW@INC\fR path than it was previously installed. This is not really a
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm problem, you would have the same problem when installing the
module manually. The easiest way to prevent this behaviour is to add
the argument \f(CW\*(C`UNINST=1\*(C'\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR call, and that is why
many people add this argument permanently by configuring
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  o conf make_install_arg UNINST=1
.Ve
.IP "2)" 4
So why is UNINST=1 not the default?
.Sp
Because there are people who have their precise expectations about who
may install where in the \f(CW@INC\fR path and who uses which \f(CW@INC\fR array. In
fine tuned environments \f(CW\*(C`UNINST=1\*(C'\fR can cause damage.
.IP "3)" 4
I want to clean up my mess, and install a new perl along with
all modules I have. How do I go about it?
.Sp
Run the autobundle command for your old perl and optionally rename the
resulting bundle file (e.g. Bundle/mybundle.pm), install the new perl
with the Configure option prefix, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ./Configure -Dprefix=/usr/local/perl-5.6.78.9
.Ve
.Sp
Install the bundle file you produced in the first step with something like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cpan> install Bundle::mybundle
.Ve
.Sp
and you're done.
.IP "4)" 4
When I install bundles or multiple modules with one command
there is too much output to keep track of.
.Sp
You may want to configure something like
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  o conf make_arg "| tee -ai /root/.cpan/logs/make.out"
\&  o conf make_install_arg "| tee -ai /root/.cpan/logs/make_install.out"
.Ve
.Sp
so that \s-1STDOUT\s0 is captured in a file for later inspection.
.IP "5)" 4
I am not root, how can I install a module in a personal directory?
.Sp
First of all, you will want to use your own configuration, not the one
that your root user installed. If you do not have permission to write
in the cpan directory that root has configured, you will be asked if
you want to create your own config. Answering \*(L"yes\*(R" will bring you into
\&\s-1CPAN\s0's configuration stage, using the system config for all defaults except
things that have to do with \s-1CPAN\s0's work directory, saving your choices to
your MyConfig.pm file.
.Sp
You can also manually initiate this process with the following command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % perl -MCPAN -e 'mkmyconfig'
.Ve
.Sp
or by running
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    mkmyconfig
.Ve
.Sp
from the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell.
.Sp
You will most probably also want to configure something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  o conf makepl_arg "LIB=~/myperl/lib \e
\&                    INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 \e
\&                    INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3 \e
\&                    INSTALLSCRIPT=~/myperl/bin \e
\&                    INSTALLBIN=~/myperl/bin"
.Ve
.Sp
and then (oh joy) the equivalent command for Module::Build. That would
be
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  o conf mbuildpl_arg "--lib=~/myperl/lib \e
\&                    --installman1dir=~/myperl/man/man1 \e
\&                    --installman3dir=~/myperl/man/man3 \e
\&                    --installscript=~/myperl/bin \e
\&                    --installbin=~/myperl/bin"
.Ve
.Sp
You can make this setting permanent like all \f(CW\*(C`o conf\*(C'\fR settings with
\&\f(CW\*(C`o conf commit\*(C'\fR or by setting \f(CW\*(C`auto_commit\*(C'\fR beforehand.
.Sp
You will have to add ~/myperl/man to the \s-1MANPATH\s0 environment variable
and also tell your perl programs to look into ~/myperl/lib, e.g. by
including
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  use lib "$ENV{HOME}/myperl/lib";
.Ve
.Sp
or setting the \s-1PERL5LIB\s0 environment variable.
.Sp
While we're speaking about \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1HOME\s0}, it might be worth mentioning,
that for Windows we use the File::HomeDir module that provides an
equivalent to the concept of the home directory on Unix.
.Sp
Another thing you should bear in mind is that the \s-1UNINST\s0 parameter can
be dangerous when you are installing into a private area because you
might accidentally remove modules that other people depend on that are
not using the private area.
.IP "6)" 4
How to get a package, unwrap it, and make a change before building it?
.Sp
Have a look at the \f(CW\*(C`look\*(C'\fR (!) command.
.IP "7)" 4
I installed a Bundle and had a couple of fails. When I
retried, everything resolved nicely. Can this be fixed to work
on first try?
.Sp
The reason for this is that \s-1CPAN\s0 does not know the dependencies of all
modules when it starts out. To decide about the additional items to
install, it just uses data found in the \s-1META\s0.yml file or the generated
Makefile. An undetected missing piece breaks the process. But it may
well be that your Bundle installs some prerequisite later than some
depending item and thus your second try is able to resolve everything.
Please note, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm does not know the dependency tree in advance and
cannot sort the queue of things to install in a topologically correct
order. It resolves perfectly well \s-1IF\s0 all modules declare the
prerequisites correctly with the \s-1PREREQ_PM\s0 attribute to MakeMaker or
the \f(CW\*(C`requires\*(C'\fR stanza of Module::Build. For bundles which fail and
you need to install often, it is recommended to sort the Bundle
definition file manually.
.IP "8)" 4
In our intranet we have many modules for internal use. How
can I integrate these modules with \s-1CPAN\s0.pm but without uploading
the modules to \s-1CPAN\s0?
.Sp
Have a look at the CPAN::Site module.
.IP "9)" 4
When I run \s-1CPAN\s0's shell, I get an error message about things in my
/etc/inputrc (or ~/.inputrc) file.
.Sp
These are readline issues and can only be fixed by studying readline
configuration on your architecture and adjusting the referenced file
accordingly. Please make a backup of the /etc/inputrc or ~/.inputrc
and edit them. Quite often harmless changes like uppercasing or
lowercasing some arguments solves the problem.
.IP "10)" 4
.IX Item "10)"
Some authors have strange characters in their names.
.Sp
Internally \s-1CPAN\s0.pm uses the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 charset. If your terminal is
expecting \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0 charset, a converter can be activated by setting
term_is_latin to a true value in your config file. One way of doing so
would be
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cpan> o conf term_is_latin 1
.Ve
.Sp
If other charset support is needed, please file a bugreport against
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm at rt.cpan.org and describe your needs. Maybe we can extend
the support or maybe \s-1UTF\-8\s0 terminals become widely available.
.Sp
Note: this config variable is deprecated and will be removed in a
future version of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm. It will be replaced with the conventions
around the family of \f(CW$LANG\fR and \f(CW$LC_\fR* environment variables.

When an install fails for some reason and then I correct the error
condition and retry, \s-1CPAN\s0.pm refuses to install the module, saying

Use the force pragma like so
.Sp
.Vb 1

How do I install a \*(L"\s-1DEVELOPER\s0 \s-1RELEASE\s0\*(R" of a module?
.Sp
By default, \s-1CPAN\s0 will install the latest non-developer release of a
module. If you want to install a dev release, you have to specify the
partial path starting with the author id to the tarball you wish to
install, like so:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cpan> install KWILLIAMS/Module-Build-0.27_07.tar.gz

How do I install a module and all its dependencies from the commandline,
without being prompted for anything, despite my \s-1CPAN\s0 configuration

asked any questions at all (assuming the modules you are installing are
nice about obeying that variable as well):

I'm frequently irritated with the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell's inability to help me
select a good mirror.
.Sp
The urllist config parameter is yours. You can add and remove sites at
will. You should find out which sites have the best uptodateness,
bandwidth, reliability, etc. and are topologically close to you. Some
people prefer fast downloads, others uptodateness, others reliability.
You decide which to try in which order.

Older versions of \s-1CPAN\s0.pm had the original root directory of all
tarballs in the build directory. Now there are always random
characters appended to these directory names. Why was this done?
.Sp
The random characters are provided by File::Temp and ensure that each
module's individual build directory is unique. This makes running
\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm in concurrent processes simultaneously safe.

Speaking of the build directory. Do I have to clean it up myself?

You have the choice to set the config variable \f(CW\*(C`scan_cache\*(C'\fR to

value, \f(CW\*(C`atstart\*(C'\fR only cleans up the build directory when you start
the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell. If you never start up the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell, you probably
also have to clean up the build directory yourself.

\&\s-1CPAN\s0.pm is regularly tested to run under 5.004, 5.005, and assorted
newer versions. It is getting more and more difficult to get the

impossible to get the whole Bundle::CPAN working there. If you're in

designed to work fine without the Bundle::CPAN installed.

To get things going, note that GBARR/Scalar\-List\-Utils\-1.18.tar.gz is
