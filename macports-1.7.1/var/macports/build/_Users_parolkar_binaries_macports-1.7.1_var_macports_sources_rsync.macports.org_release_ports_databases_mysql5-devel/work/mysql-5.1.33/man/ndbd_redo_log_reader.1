.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Reads a redo log file, checking it for errors, printing its contents in a human\-readable format, or both.
\fBndbd_redo_log_reader\fR
is intended for use primarily by MySQL developers and support personnel in debugging and diagnosing problems.
.PP
This utility was made available as part of default builds beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.1.3. It remains under development, and its syntax and behavior are subject to change in future releases. For this reason, it should be considered experimental at this time.
.PP
The C++ source files for
\fBndbd_redo_log_reader\fR
can be found in the directory
\fI/storage/ndb/src/kernel/blocks/dblqh/redoLogReader\fR.

\fIfile_name\fR
is the name of a cluster REDO log file. REDO log files are located in the numbered directories under the data node's data directory (DataDir); the path under this directory to the REDO log files matches the pattern
\fIndb_\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fI_fs/D\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fI/LCP/\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fI/T\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fIF\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fI.Data\fR. In each case, the
\fI#\fR
represents a number (not necessarily the same number). For more information, see
[1]\&\fICluster Data Node FileSystemDir Files\fR.
.PP
\fBAdditional Options\fR:
.PP
The name of the file to be read may be followed by one or more of the options listed here:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-noprint\fR: Do not print the contents of the log file.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-nocheck\fR: Do not check the log filre for errors.

Like
\fBndb_print_backup_file\fR
and
\fBndb_print_schema_file\fR
(and unlike most of the
NDB
utilities that are intended to be run on a management server host or to connect to a management server)
\fBndbd_redo_log_reader\fR
must be run on a cluster data node, since it accesses the data node file system directly. Because it does not make use of the management server, this utility can be used when the management server is not running, and even when the cluster has been completely shut down.
