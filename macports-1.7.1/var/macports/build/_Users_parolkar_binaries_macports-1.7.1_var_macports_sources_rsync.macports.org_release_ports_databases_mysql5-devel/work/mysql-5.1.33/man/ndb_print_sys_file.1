.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBndb_print_sys_file\fR
obtains diagnostic information from a MySQL Cluster system file.

\fBUsage\fR:

\fIfile_name\fR
is the name of a cluster system file (sysfile). Cluster system files are located in a data node's data directory (DataDir); the path under this directory to system files matches the pattern
\fIndb_\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fI_fs/D\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fI/DBDIH/P\fR\fI\fI#\fR\fR\fI.sysfile\fR. In each case, the
\fI#\fR
represents a number (not necessarily the same number). For more information, see
[1]\&\fICluster Data Node FileSystemDir Files\fR.
.PP
Like
\fBndb_print_backup_file\fR
and
\fBndb_print_schema_file\fR
(and unlike most of the other
NDB
utilities that are intended to be run on a management server host or to connect to a management server)
\fBndb_print_backup_file\fR
must be run on a cluster data node, since it accesses the data node file system directly. Because it does not make use of the management server, this utility can be used when the management server is not running, and even when the cluster has been completely shut down.
.PP
\fBAdditional Options\fR: None.
