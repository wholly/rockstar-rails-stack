\fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
should be executed each time you upgrade MySQL. It checks all tables in all databases for incompatibilities with the current version of MySQL Server. If a table is found to have a possible incompatibility, it is checked. If any problems are found, the table is repaired.
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
also upgrades the system tables so that you can take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have been added.
.PP
All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current MySQL version number. This ensures that next time you run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
with the same version of the server, it can tell whether there is any need to check or repair the table again.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
also saves the MySQL version number in a file named
\fImysql_upgrade_info\fR
in the data directory. This is used to quickly check if all tables have been checked for this release so that table\-checking can be skipped. To ignore this file, use the
\fB\-\-force\fR
option.

\fBCaution\fR
.PP
Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling
\fIbefore\fR
you upgrade your MySQL installation and run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR. See
Section\ 2.12.1, \(lqUpgrading MySQL\(rq, for instructions on determining whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation and how to handle them.
.PP
To check and repair tables and to upgrade the system tables,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
executes the following commands:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysqlcheck \-\-check\-upgrade \-\-all\-databases \-\-auto\-repair
mysql_fix_privilege_tables
mysqlcheck \-\-all\-databases \-\-check\-upgrade \-\-fix\-db\-names \-\-fix\-table\-names

\fBNote\fR
.PP
Prior to MySQL 5.1.31,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
does not run the third command, which is necessary to re\-encode database or table names that contain non\-alphanumeric characters. (They still appear after the upgrade with the
#mysql50#
prefix described in
Section\ 8.2.3, \(lqMapping of Identifiers to File Names\(rq.) If you have such database or table names, execute the third command manually after executing
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
supersedes the older
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR
script. In MySQL 5.1.7,
\fBmysql_upgrade \fR
was added as a shell script and worked only for Unix systems. As of MySQL 5.1.10,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
is an executable binary and is available on all systems. On systems older than those supporting
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, you can execute the
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
command manually, and then upgrade your system tables as described in
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR(1).
.PP
If you install MySQL from RPM packages on Linux, you must install the server and client RPMs.
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
is included in the server RPM but requires the client RPM because the latter includes
\fBmysqlcheck\fR. (See
Section\ 2.4, \(lqInstalling MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux\(rq.)
.PP
For details about what is checked, see the description of the
FOR UPGRADE
option of the
CHECK TABLE
statement (see
Section\ 12.5.2.3, \(lqCHECK TABLE Syntax\(rq).
.PP
To use
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, make sure that the server is running, and then invoke it like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
After running
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, stop the server and restart it so that it uses any changes that were made to the system tables.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
reads options from the command line and from the
[mysql_upgrade]
group in option files. It supports the options in the following list. Other options are passed to
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
and to
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR. For example, it might be necessary to specify the
\fB\-\-password[=\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR
option.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR
.sp
Display a short help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-basedir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp

.sp
The path to the data directory.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug\-check\fR

.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-force\fR
.sp
Force execution of
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
even if
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
has already been executed for the current version of MySQL. (In other words, this option causes the
\fImysql_upgrade_info\fR
file to be ignored.)

\fB\-\-tmpdir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR,
\fB\-t \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
