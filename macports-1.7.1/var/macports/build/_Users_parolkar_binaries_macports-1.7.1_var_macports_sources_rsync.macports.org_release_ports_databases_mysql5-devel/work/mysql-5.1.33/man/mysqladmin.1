.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysqladmin\fR
is a client for performing administrative operations. You can use it to check the server's configuration and current status, to create and drop databases, and more.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysqladmin\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysqladmin [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcommand\-arg\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fIcommand\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcommand\-arg\fR\fR\fB]] ...\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBmysqladmin\fR
supports the commands described in the following list. Some of the commands take an argument following the command name.
.TP 3n
\(bu
create \fIdb_name\fR
.sp
Create a new database named
\fIdb_name\fR.
.TP 3n
\(bu
debug
.sp
Tell the server to write debug information to the error log.
.sp
Beginning with MySQL 5.1.12, this includes information about the Event Scheduler. See
Section\ 19.4.5, \(lqEvent Scheduler Status\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
drop \fIdb_name\fR
.sp
Delete the database named
\fIdb_name\fR
and all its tables.
.TP 3n
\(bu
extended\-status
.sp
Display the server status variables and their values.
.TP 3n
\(bu
flush\-hosts
.sp
Flush all information in the host cache.
.TP 3n
\(bu
flush\-logs
.sp
Flush all logs.
.TP 3n
\(bu
flush\-privileges
.sp
Reload the grant tables (same as
reload).
.TP 3n
\(bu
flush\-status
.sp
Clear status variables.
.TP 3n
\(bu
flush\-tables
.sp
Flush all tables.
.TP 3n
\(bu
flush\-threads
.sp
Flush the thread cache.
.TP 3n
\(bu
kill \fIid\fR,\fIid\fR,...
.sp
Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are given, there must be no spaces in the list.
.TP 3n
\(bu
old\-password \fInew\-password\fR
.sp
This is like the
password
command but stores the password using the old (pre\-4.1) password\-hashing format. (See
Section\ 5.4.7, \(lqPassword Hashing as of MySQL 4.1\(rq.)
.TP 3n
\(bu
password \fInew\-password\fR
.sp
Set a new password. This changes the password to
\fInew\-password\fR
for the account that you use with
\fBmysqladmin\fR
for connecting to the server. Thus, the next time you invoke
\fBmysqladmin\fR
(or any other client program) using the same account, you will need to specify the new password.
.sp
If the
\fInew\-password\fR
value contains spaces or other characters that are special to your command interpreter, you need to enclose it within quotes. On Windows, be sure to use double quotes rather than single quotes; single quotes are not stripped from the password, but rather are interpreted as part of the password. For example:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysqladmin password "my new password"\fR
.fi
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
\fBCaution\fR
Do not use this command used if the server was started with the
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR
option. No password change will be applied. This is true even if you precede the
password
command with
flush\-privileges
on the same command line to re\-enable the grant tables because the flush operation occurs after you connect. However, you can use
\fBmysqladmin flush\-privileges\fR
to re\-enable the grant table and then use a separate
\fBmysqladmin password\fR
command to change the password.
.TP 3n
\(bu
ping
.sp
Check whether the server is alive. The return status from
\fBmysqladmin\fR
is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not. This is 0 even in case of an error such as
Access denied, because this means that the server is running but refused the connection, which is different from the server not running.
.TP 3n
\(bu
processlist
.sp
Show a list of active server threads. This is like the output of the
SHOW PROCESSLIST
statement. If the
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
option is given, the output is like that of
SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST. (See
Section\ 12.5.5.31, \(lqSHOW PROCESSLIST Syntax\(rq.)
.TP 3n
\(bu
reload
.sp
Reload the grant tables.
.TP 3n
\(bu
refresh
.sp
Flush all tables and close and open log files.
.TP 3n
\(bu
shutdown
.sp
Stop the server.
.TP 3n
\(bu
start\-slave
.sp
Start replication on a slave server.
.TP 3n
\(bu
status
.sp
Display a short server status message.
.TP 3n
\(bu
stop\-slave
.sp
Stop replication on a slave server.
.TP 3n
\(bu
variables
.sp
Display the server system variables and their values.
.TP 3n
\(bu
version
.sp
Display version information from the server.
.sp
.RE
.PP
All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix. For example:

If you execute
\fBmysqladmin shutdown\fR
when connecting to a local server using a Unix socket file,
\fBmysqladmin\fR
waits until the server's process ID file has been removed, to ensure that the server has stopped properly.
.PP
