# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test if statements used temporary tables are binlogged correctly
#
# ==== Method ====
#
# Use two connections, use temporary tables on both of them, and by
# switching connections between statements, the test can check if the
# statements are logged with the correct thread id.
# 
# The statements current tested include:
#   CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
#   CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE LIKE
#   INSERT
#   REPLACE
#   UPDATE
#   INSERT SELECT
#   TRUNCATE
#
# Note: When adding new query statements, please add them between the
# two 'flush logs'. And aslo please make sure the connection is
# switched between each statement.
#
