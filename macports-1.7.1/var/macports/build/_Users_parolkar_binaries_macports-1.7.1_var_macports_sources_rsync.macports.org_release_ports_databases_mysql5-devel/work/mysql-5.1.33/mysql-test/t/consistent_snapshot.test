### Test 1:
### - While a consistent snapshot transaction is executed,
###   no external inserts should be visible to the transaction.

--echo # Switch to connection con1
connection con1;
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT) ENGINE=innodb;
START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT;

--echo # Switch to connection con2
connection con2;
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);

--echo # Switch to connection con1
connection con1;
SELECT * FROM t1; # if consistent snapshot was set as expected, we
# should see nothing.
COMMIT;

### Test 2:
### - For any non-consistent snapshot transaction, external
###   committed inserts should be visible to the transaction.

DELETE FROM t1;
START TRANSACTION; # Now we omit WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT

--echo # Switch to connection con2
connection con2;
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1);

--echo # Switch to connection con1
connection con1;
SELECT * FROM t1; # if consistent snapshot was not set, as expected, we
# should see 1.
COMMIT;

--echo # Switch to connection default + close connections con1 and con2
connection default;
disconnect con1;
disconnect con2;
DROP TABLE t1;
