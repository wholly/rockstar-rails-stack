This file explains the automated jobs that live in this directory and keep MacPorts running at the server level,
appart from the basic mail, mailman, www, trac & svn services:

 1) mprsyncup:
    Runs on Mac OS Forge servers every 30 minutes, on the hour and on the half hour, off launchd through the org.macports.mprsyncup.plist provided.
    Repopulates the rsync modules that feed the "sync" and "selfupdate" operations for both the ports tree and MacPorts sources, freshly off the svn
    sources.

 2) PortIndexRegen:
    Still running on Daniel's box, twice a day every 12 hours off cron. Scheduled for a rewrite in Tcl to employ the macports1.0 API and thus simplify
    some of its tasks. Once that's done it'll be moved to Mac OS Forge servers. This job regenerates the ports' index employed by operations like "port search".

 3) PortIndex2MySQL:
    Running Mac OS Forge servers twice a day every 12 hours off launchd through the org.macports.PortIndex2MySQL.plist provided, 15 minutes after the
    PortIndexRegen job. This jobs repopulates the database that feeds the www.macports.org/ports.php page off the regenerated PortIndex.

 4) GuideRegen:
    Running on Mac OS Forge servers as an svn post-commit hook after commits to the /trunk/doc-new dir take place. Regenerates the project guide found at
    http://guide.macports.org

 5) Website:
    There's actually no script for this one, as the job itself is really simple: a post-commit svn hook attached to the /trunk/www dir
    updates the copy of our website on the Mac OS Forge web server whenever a commit to that directory occurs.
