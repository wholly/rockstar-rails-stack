description     GNU Which - Everything you never wanted in a which
long_description \
    Which is a utility that prints out the full path of the executables \
    that bash would execute when the passed program names would have    \
    been entered on the shell prompt. It does this by using the exact   \
    same algorithm as bash. Tildes and a dot in the PATH are now        \
    expanded to the full path by default.  Options allow to rather print\
    '~/*' or './*' and/or to print all executables that match any       \
    directory in PATH.
