description      program that emulates the detach feature of screen
long_description \
	dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of \
	screen, allowing you to run a program in an environment that \
	is protected from the controlling terminal and attach to it \
	later. dtach does not keep track of the contents of the \
	screen, and thus works best with programs that know how to \
	redraw themselves.
