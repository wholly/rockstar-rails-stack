long_description \
    srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm, it   \
    overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them. This \
    prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw     \
    block device. It may also help frustrate physical examination of the\
    disk, although it's unlikely that it can completely prevent that    \
    type of recovery. It is, essentially, a paper shredder for sensitive\
    files.
