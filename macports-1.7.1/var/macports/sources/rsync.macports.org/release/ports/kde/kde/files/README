==MacPorts KDE==

To start the KDE desktop (this works best in full-screen X11 mode), comment 
out quartz-wm in your .xinitrc, and add this:
exec ${prefix}/bin/startkde
where ${prefix} is your MP prefix.

Alternatively, if you just want to run individual KDE applications, start 
X11, and run them from the command line.

==AQ (maybe one day this will be a FAQ)==

Q1 When I start, any KDE application, it comes up fine, but with the fonts all squares.
A1 Try 'sudo fc-cache'

Q2 When I type sudo fc-cache, I get 'Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file'
A2 Do you have the file /etc/fonts/fonts.conf?  If not, you probably need to 
   install/reinstall stuff (X11, Developer Tools...) from the CDs that came with your computer.

Q3 I get errors like 'artsd: illegal option -- c'
A3 KDE is attempting to communicate with an old version of the arts sound server that is 
   installed on your system.  Sound is disabled in the current KDE ports.  By explicitly 
   disabling sound in kcontrol, you may be able to stop KDE producing these errors.  
   Alternatively, uninstall the arts port.

Q4 My question isn't answered here...
