description		Hermes is a pixel conversion library.
long_description	Hermes is a pixel conversion library. Its only purpose \
				is to take a buffer full of pixels and convert it into a \
				target buffer full of pixels. The two can differ both in size \
				and in format. Hermes is primarily intended for fast graphics \
				display and it is optimized for that. Where this goal can be \
				achieved by dismissing minimal graphic errors, Hermes will do \
				so (minimal means almost not noticeable). But that is likely \
				to be very configurable in the near future to allow for user \
				selection of trade-off.
