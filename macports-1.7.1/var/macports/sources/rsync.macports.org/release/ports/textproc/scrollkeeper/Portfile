long_description	\
	ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation on open systems. \
	It manages documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source \
	Metadata Framework (OMF) and provides a simple API to allow help \
	browsers to find, sort, and search the document catalog.  It will also \
	be able to communicate with catalog servers on the Net to search for \
	documents which are not on the local system. \n\n\
	This port has been made obsolete by port rarian, which is a drop-in \
	replacement for this port.
