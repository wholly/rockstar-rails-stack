description		parser generator for XML
long_description	XCC is a tool for building XML format parsers. One way to \
			describe what XCC does is by analogy with a generic parser \
			generator, e.g. yacc or bison. Yacc needs a lexical analyzer to \
			function properly, and that lexical analyzer is usually built \
			with (f)lex. In the XML world, there are a few packages which fill \
			in the role of lex (expat and libxml are the most known), but the \
			high-level grammar parsing is usually done by a hand-written code. \
			Writing such a parser is a tedious and error-prone task.
