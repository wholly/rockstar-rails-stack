long_description    In the spirit of the UNIX Operating System, Aegis is a \
                    small component designed to work with other programs. \
                    Among other things, it supports geographically \
                    distributed development on both push and pull models and \
                    on many distribution topologies, concurrent editing, \
                    atomic locking for changesets over multiple files, and \
                    perhaps most usefully, enforcement of tests on changes to \
                    the baseline to ensure that it always works.
