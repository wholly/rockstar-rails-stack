description   Rebase plugin for bzr
long_description  Rebasing is the process of taking a branch and \
    modifying the history so that it appears to start from a different \
    point. This can be useful to clean up the history before submitting \
    your changes. The tree at the end of the process will be the same \
    as if you had merged the other branch, but the history will be \
    different.
