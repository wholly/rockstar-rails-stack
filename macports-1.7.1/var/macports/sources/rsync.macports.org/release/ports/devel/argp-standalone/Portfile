PortSystem 1.0

name			argp-standalone
version			1.3
categories		devel
platforms		darwin freebsd
maintainers		afb@macports.org
description		Standalone version of arguments parsing functions from GLIBC
long_description	It is standalone version of argp - part of glibc library. \
\
It was separated off glibc by Niels Myller, Niels primary use \
it for inclusion in the LSH distribution, but it's useful for \
any package that wants to use argp and at the same time be \
portable to non-glibc systems. \
\
Besides portability fixes, there are a few other changes in \
this version. The most important is that it no longer builds \
upon getopt\; the one or two hairy functions of GNU getopt are \
incorporated with the argp parser. There are longer any global \
variables keeping track of the parser state.
