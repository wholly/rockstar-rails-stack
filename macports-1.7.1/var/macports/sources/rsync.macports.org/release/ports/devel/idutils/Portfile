description      The classic Berkeley gid/lid tools for looking up variables in code
long_description `mkid' is a simple, fast, high-capacity, language-independent \
	             identifier database tool.  Actually, the term `identifier' is too \
	             limiting--`mkid' stores tokens, be they program identifiers of any \
	             form, literal numbers, or words of human-readable text.  Database \
	             queries can be issued from the command-line, or from within emacs, \
	             serving as an augmented tags facility. \
	             \
	             `mkid' was originally written by Greg McGary <gkm@gnu.ai.mit.edu> \
	             and posted to comp.sources.unix in September 1987.  It was then \
	             maintained and enhanced by a loose knit group of programmers on the \
	             Internet led by Tom Horsley <Tom.Horsley@mail.hcsc.com>.  Tom released \
	             `mkid2' on comp.sources.unix in March, 1991.  Since then, Greg McGary \
	             has resumed maintenance and is releasing an improved version 3 under GPL.\
	             \
	             Version 3 is an interim release.  Version 4 will follow in the coming \
	             months and include a cscope clone plus other improvements.  This \
	             version is an improved version of version 3 (which hasn't been updated \
	             since 1996!), it now understands C++.
