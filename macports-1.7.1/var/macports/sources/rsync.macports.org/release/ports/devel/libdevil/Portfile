description         Library to develop applications with powerful image \
                    loading capabilities
long_description    Developer's Image Library (DevIL) is a programmer's \
                    library to develop applications with very powerful image \
                    loading capabilities, yet is easy for a developer to \
                    learn and use. Ultimate control of images is left to the \
                    developer, so unnecessary conversions, etc. are not \
                    performed. DevIL utilizes a simple, yet powerful, \
                    syntax. DevIL can load, save, convert, manipulate, \
                    filter and display a wide variety of image formats. \
                    Formerly known as OpenIL, but the name was changed due \
                    to SGI's request.
