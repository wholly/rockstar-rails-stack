The cups-headers port is a placeholder port that is only really meaningful
on Mac OS X 10.3.x (Panther).

If you have ports on other versions of Mac OS X that break on bad cups headers
or library files, then this port should be uninstalled.

This port should only install this readme file on versions of Mac OS X other
than Panther.
