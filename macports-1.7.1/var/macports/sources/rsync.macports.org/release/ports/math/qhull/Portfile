description Programs and library for computing convex hulls.
long_description	\
	Qhull computes the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi \
	diagram, halfspace intersection about a point, furthest-site \
	Delaunay triangulation, and furthest-site Voronoi diagram. The \
	software runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. Qhull \
	implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. \
	It handles roundoff errors from floating point arithmetic. Qhull \
	also computes volumes, surface areas, and approximations to the \
	convex hull.
