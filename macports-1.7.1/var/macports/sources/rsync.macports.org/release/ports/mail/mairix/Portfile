description         Email index and search tool
long_description    mairix is a program for indexing and searching email \
                    messages stored in Maildir, MH or mbox folders.      \
                    Indexing is fast. It runs incrementally on new       \
                    messages - any particular message only gets scanned  \
                    once in the lifetime of the index file. The search   \
                    mode populates a "virtual" maildir (or MH) folder    \
                    with symlinks which point to the real messages. This \
                    folder can be opened as usual in your mail program.  \
                    The search mode is very fast. Indexing and searching \
                    works on the basis of words. The index file tabulates\
                    which words occur in which parts (particular headers \
                    + body) of which messages.
