description		XRG is an open source system monitor for Mac OS X.
long_description	XRG allows you to monitor CPU activity, memory \
					usage, battery status, machine temperature, network \
					activity, disk I/O, current weather, and stock \
					market data. The goal of XRG is to be a functional \
					system monitor that has a clean and flexible \
					interface, so it doesn't intrude on the rest of your \
					Mac experience. XRG is designed to take as little \
					CPU time as possible while still showing detailed \
					graphs on system usage.
