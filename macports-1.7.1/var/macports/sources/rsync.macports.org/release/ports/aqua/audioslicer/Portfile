long_description \
	AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI application that finds all silences \
	in an audio file and allows you to split it into several smaller \
	audio files and to name/tag them properly. For now only MP3 is \
	supported but other audio formats may be added in the future. \
	While most other tools doing this split automatically according \
	to certain criteria, AudioSlicer shows you all silences within a \
	certain range of duration. You can then listen to the silence - \
	well, to the audio before and after the silence really - and \
	then you decide if you want to split there. The splitting is \
	done without loss, there is no decoding and re-encoding of audio \
	data taking place.
