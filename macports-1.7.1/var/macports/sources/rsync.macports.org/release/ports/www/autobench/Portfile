description      automatic webserver benchmark tool
long_description \
    Autobench is a simple Perl script for automating the process \
    of benchmarking a web server (or for conducting a comparative \
    test of two different web servers). The script is a wrapper \
    around httperf. Autobench runs httperf a number of times \
    against each host, increasing the number of requested \
    connections per second on each iteration, and extracts the \
    significant data from the httperf output, delivering a CSV or \
    TSV format file which can be imported directly into a \
    spreadsheet for analysis/graphing.
