description         two Apple iTMS/iTunes key descrambling algorithms
long_description    The first algorithm appears to have only cursory \
                    resemblance to Bruce Schneier's blowfish and twofish \
                    algorithms in that it too has a table-based decoder. \
                    The second algorithm is more standard encryption using \
                    S-box type permutations and lookup tables, and might \
                    have started out something like Twofish or Blowfish.
