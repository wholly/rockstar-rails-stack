description           Perl interface to Monotone via automate stdio
long_description      The Monotone::AutomateStdio class gives a Perl developer \
                      access to Monotone's automate stdio facility via an easy \
                      to use interface. All command, option and output formats \
                      are handled internally by this class. Any structured \
                      information returned by Monotone is parsed and returned \
                      back to the caller as lists of records for ease of \
                      access or alternatively as one large string.
