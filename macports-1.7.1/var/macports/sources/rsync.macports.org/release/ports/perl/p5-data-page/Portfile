description           help when paging through sets of results
long_description      When searching through large amounts of data, it is \
                      often the case that a result set is returned that is \
                      larger than we want to display on one page. This \
                      results in wanting to page through various pages of \
                      data. The maths behind this is unfortunately fiddly, \
                      hence this module.
