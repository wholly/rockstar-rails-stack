description     A perl 5 module for sorting of revision-like numbers.
long_description Sort::Versions allows easy sorting of mixed non-numeric and numeric \
                strings, like the 'version numbers' that many shared library systems \
                and revision control packages use. This is quite useful if you are \
                trying to deal with shared libraries. It can also be applied to applications \
                that intersperse variable-width numeric fields within text.
