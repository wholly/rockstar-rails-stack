description           Provides basic first-pass API testing for large class trees
long_description      For many APIs with large numbers of classes, it can be \
                      very useful to be able to do a quick once-over to make \
                      sure that classes, methods, and inheritance is correct, \
                      before doing more comprehensive testing. This module \
                      aims to provide such a capability.
