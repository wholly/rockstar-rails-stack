description		A pure perl persistent multi-level hash/array DBM

long_description \
	A unique flat-file database module, written in pure perl. True multi-level \
	hash/array support (unlike MLDBM, which is faked), hybrid OO / tie() \
	interface, cross-platform FTPable files, and quite fast. Can handle \
	millions of keys and unlimited hash levels without significant slow-down. \
	Written from the ground-up in pure perl -- this is NOT a wrapper around a \
	C-based DBM.
