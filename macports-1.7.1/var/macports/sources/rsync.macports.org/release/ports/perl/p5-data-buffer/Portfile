description	binary buffers for perl
long_description	Data::Buffer implements a low-level binary buffer \
			in which you can get and put integers, strings, \
			and other data. Internally the implementation is \
			based on pack and unpack, such that Data::Buffer \
			is really a layer on top of those built-in functions.
