description     Cryptographically Secure, True Random Number Generator.
long_description Crypt::Random is an interface module to the /dev/random device found on most \
                modern Unix systems. The /dev/random driver gathers environmental noise from \
                various non-deterministic sources including inter-keyboard timings and \
                inter-interrupt timings that occur within the operating system environment.
