description		utilities for reading, transforming, etc. a patch
long_description	PatchReader is a set of utilities for reading in, \
					transforming, and doing various other things with a \
					patch.  It basically allows you to create a chain of \
					readers that can read a patch, remove files from a \
					patch, add CVS context, fix up the patch root \
					according to CVS, and output the patch as raw \
					unified or through a template processor (used in \
					some places to output a patch as HTML).
