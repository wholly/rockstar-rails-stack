description			Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken
long_description \
	Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good \
	when written in prose. For this reason, we tend to say things like \
	"customer" or "basket" when we are referring to \
	My::Site::User::Customer or My::Site::Shop::Basket. We thought it would \
	be nice if our classes knew what we would prefer to call them.
