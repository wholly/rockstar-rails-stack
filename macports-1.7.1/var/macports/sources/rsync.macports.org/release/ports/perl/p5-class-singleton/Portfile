description         Implementation of a "Singleton" class
long_description    This is the Class::Singleton module. A Singleton \
                    describes an object class that can have only one instance \
                    in any system. An example of a Singleton might be a print \
                    spooler or system registry. This module implements a \
                    Singleton class from which other classes can be derived. \
                    By itself, the Class::Singleton module does very little \
                    other than manage the instantiation of a single object. \
                    In deriving a class from Class::Singleton, your module \
                    will inherit the Singleton instantiation method and can \
                    implement whatever specific functionality is required.
