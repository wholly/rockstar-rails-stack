description		time and date parsing routines
long_description	This module replaces my earlier GetDate module, \
					which was only a date parser. The date parser \
					contained in this distribution is far superior to \
					the yacc based parser, and a *lot* faster. \
					The parser contained here will only parse absolute \
					dates, if you want a date parser that can parse \
					relative dates then take a look at the Time modules \
					by David Muir on CPAN.
