description           Role based authorization for Catalyst based \
                      on Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication
long_description      Role based access control is very simple: every user \
                      has a list of roles, which that user is allowed to \
                      assume, and every restricted part of the app makes \
                      an assertion about the necessary roles.
