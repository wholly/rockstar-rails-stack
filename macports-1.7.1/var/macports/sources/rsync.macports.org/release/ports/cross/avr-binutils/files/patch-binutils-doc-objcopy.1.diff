+When converting debugging information using \fB\-\-debugging\fR, for
+every pathname that starts with \fIold\fR, replace the matching part
+by \fInew\fR.  This is intented to map pathnames between different
+debugging tools, or when parts of the object file(s) had their
+pathnames recorded in a different build environment.  Note that only
+leading directory name components might be changed that way, since the
+trailing filename could be recorded elsewhere as well (depending on the
+debugging format of the input file).
+.IP "\fB\-\-basename\fR"
+.IX Item "--basename"
+When converting debugging information using \fB\-\-debugging\fR, for
+every pathname, strip all leading directory information.  This option
+takes precedence over any \fB\-\-change\-pathname\fR option.  For some
+debugging formats that cannot handle long filenames, this options is
+implied (notably, some COFF debugging formats).
