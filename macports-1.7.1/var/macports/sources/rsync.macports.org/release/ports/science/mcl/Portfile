long_description \
    TribeMCL is a method for clustering proteins into related groups, which are \
    termed 'protein families'. This clustering is achieved by analysing similarity \
    patterns between proteins in a given dataset, and using these patterns to \
    assign proteins into related groups. In many cases, proteins in the same protein \
    family will have similar functional properties. TribeMCL uses a novel clustering \
    method (Markov Clustering or MCL) which solves problems which normally hinder \
    protein sequence clustering.
