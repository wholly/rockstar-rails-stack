description		library for the simulation of a quantum computer
long_description	libquantum is a C library for the simulation of a quantum \
				computer. Based on the principles of quantum mechanics, it \
				provides an implementation of a quantum register. Basic \
				operations for register manipulation such as the Hadamard gate \
				or the Controlled-NOT gate are available through an \
				easy-to-use interface. Measurements can be performed on either \
				single qubits or the whole quantum register.
