long_description \
   Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2-Perl. It aims to bring the \
   concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is saved as a text file \
   with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other pages, and are saved \
   automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a \
   non-existing page. This tool is intended to keep track of TODO lists or \
   to serve as a personal scratch book. But it will also serve you when \
   writing longer and more complicated documents.
