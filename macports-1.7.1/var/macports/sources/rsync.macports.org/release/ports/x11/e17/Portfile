description	Enlightenment windowmanager DR17
long_description        Development Release 17 of the Enlightenment window \
			manager represents an evolution into the next generation \
			of desktop environments: the desktop shell. DR17 will \
			provide integration between files and your environment in a \
			seamless manner while encompassing a graphically rich and \
			flexible architecture. It will not compete with GNOME or KDE, \
			but be a completely new way of visualizing your desktop, \
			based around the EFL which was built from the ground up \
			for this task.
