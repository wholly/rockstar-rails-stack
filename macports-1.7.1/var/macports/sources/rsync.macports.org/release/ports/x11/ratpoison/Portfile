description	Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager
long_description \
    Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with \
    no fat library dependencies, no fancy graphics, \
    no window decorations, and no rodent dependence. \
    It is largely modelled after GNU Screen which \
    has done wonders in the virtual terminal market. \
    The screen can be split into non-overlapping frames. \
    All windows are kept maximized inside their frames \
    to take full advantage of your precious screen \
    real estate. All interaction with the window manager \
    is done through keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix \
    map to minimize the key clobbering that cripples \
    Emacs and other quality pieces of software.
