#user_notes             This port is intended to be used by other ports
#                       requiring the features of the latest released gcc or
#                       g++. For example, covariant returns in g++ are not
#                       supported by the standard Apple g++-3.3, but are by
#                       this version. Generally speaking, you'll know if you
#                       need this.
#
#                       The libraries are moved from their standard location
#                       so as not to conflict with the libraries installed
#                       by the system's gcc. It is necessary below to specify
#                       the C++ include path explicitly (using the
#                       --with-gxx-include-dir configure argument) because
#                       of a bug in gcc-3.4.3 that causes incorrect include
#                       paths to be generated if the library directory is
#                       changed.
