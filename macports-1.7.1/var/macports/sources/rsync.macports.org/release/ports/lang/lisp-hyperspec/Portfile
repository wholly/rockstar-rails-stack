description	The Common Lisp HyperSpec
long_description	\
		This is an HTML document derived from the ANSI Common \
		Lisp standard (X3.226-1994), with permission from ANSI \
		and NCITS (previously known as X3). \
		The Common Lisp HyperSpec was prepared by Kent Pitman at \
		Harlequin, who as Project Editor of X3J13 managed the \
		completion of the document which became the ANSI Common \
		Lisp Standard. \
		In hardcopy, the ANSI Common Lisp standard is nearly \
		1100 printed pages describing nearly a thousand functions \
		and variables in sufficient detail to accommodate hosting \
		of the language on a wide variety of hardware and operating \
		system platforms. \
		While the paper version remains the official standard, \
		we think that in practice you'll find the Common Lisp \
		HyperSpec much easier to navigate and use than its paper \
		alternative. \
		In addition to the Common Lisp standard itself, the Common \
		Lisp HyperSpec also incorporates interesting and useful \
		cross references to other materials of the Common Lisp \
		committee, J13 (formerly X3J13).
