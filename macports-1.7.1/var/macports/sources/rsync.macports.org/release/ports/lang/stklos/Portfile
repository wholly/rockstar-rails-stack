description		free Scheme system supporting most language features from R5RS
long_description	STklos is a free Scheme system supporting most of the \
				languages features defined in R5RS. The aim of this \
				implementation is to be fast as well as light. The \
				implementation is based on an ad-hoc Virtual Machine. STklos \
				can also be compiled as a library and embedded in an \
				application.
