description		safe programming language based on C
long_description	\
Cyclone is a programming language based on C that is safe, meaning that it \
rules out programs that have buffer overflows, dangling pointers, format \
string attacks, and so on. High-level, type-safe languages, such as Java, \
Scheme, or ML also provide safety, but they don't give the same control over \
data representations and memory management that C does (witness the fact that \
the run-time systems for these languages are usually written in C.) \
Furthermore, porting legacy C code to these languages or interfacing with \
legacy C libraries is a difficult and error-prone process. The goal of Cyclone \
is to give programmers the same low-level control and performance of C without \
sacrificing safety, and to make it easy to port or interface with legacy C code.
