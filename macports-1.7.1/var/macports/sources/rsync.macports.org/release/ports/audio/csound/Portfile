long_description \
    Csound is a computer programming language for dealing with sound. \
    It is called Csound because it is written in the C programming language, \
    as opposed to some of its predecessors. \
    Csound was written at MIT by Barry Vercoe, \
    based on an earlier language called Music360. \
    It is free software, available under the LGPL.
