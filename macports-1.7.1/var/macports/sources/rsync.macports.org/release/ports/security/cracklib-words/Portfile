description      Wordlists for cracklib
long_description CrackLib is a library containing a C function (well, \
                 lots of functions really, but you only need to use   \
                 one of them) which may be used in a passwd-like      \
                 program.  The idea is simple: try to prevent users   \
                 from choosing passwords that could be guessed by     \
                 Crack by filtering them out, at source.              \
                                                                      \
                 This port contains the word lists essential for      \
                 cracklib to build. There is no need to keep this     \
                 package installed, unless you feel the need to update \
                 cracklib's wordlist dictionary on occasion.
