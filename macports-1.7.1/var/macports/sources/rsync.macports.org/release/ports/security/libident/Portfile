description      Ident protocol library
long_description \
	This is a library which provides a simple \
	interface to the Ident protocol on the \
	client side. It is meant to be used by \
	daemons to try to authenticate users using \
	the Ident protocol. For this to work, \
	users need to have an Ident server running \
	on the system from which they are connected.
