description      OTR localhost AIM proxy
long_description \
	This is a localhost proxy you can use with almost any \
	AIM client in order to participate in Off-the-Record \
	conversations. The current version is 0.1.1, which \
	means it's nothing like ready for prime time. In \
	particular, it's got no UI at all (well, it outputs \
	things to stdout).
