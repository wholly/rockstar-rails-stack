description Official C++ client API for PostgreSQL

long_description \
libpqxx is the official C++ client API for PostgreSQL, the enterprise-strength \
open-source database software.  There are many similar libraries for PostgreSQL \
and for other databases, some of them database independent.  Most of these, \
however, are fairly C like in their programming style, and fail to take \
advantage of the full power of the C++ language as it has matured since \
the acceptance of the Standard in 1996.  What libpqxx brings you is effective \
use of templates to reduce the inconvenience of dealing with type conversions, \
standard C++ strings to keep you from having to worry about buffer allocation \
and overflow attacks, exceptions to take the tedious and error prone plumbing \
around error handling out of your hands, constructors and destructors to bring \
resource management under control, and even basic object orientation to give \
you some extra reliability features that would be hard to get with most other \
database interfaces.
