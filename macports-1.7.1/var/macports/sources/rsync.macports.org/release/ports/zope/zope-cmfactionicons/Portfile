description		CMFActionIcons product for use with Zope CMF/Plone
long_description	This product is a add-on for the Zope Content \
					Management Framework (CMF).  It should be useful \
					with Plone, CPS, and other CMF-derived extensions, \
					as well.  The product provides: \
					- A new tool, 'portal_actionicons', which serves as \
					a registry mapping object actions (using category \
					and action ID) to a descriptive title, a priority, \
					and an icon ID.  The tool post-processes a set of \
					actions (i.e., those generated by the \
					'portal_actions' tool), decorating them with \
					additional information, and sorting them according \
					to priority. \
					- ZPT macros which build either horizontal or \
					vertical icon bars for a set of actions.
