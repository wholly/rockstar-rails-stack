					in order to make MIME types based transformations on \
					the portal contents, and so an easy to way to plugin \
					some new transformations for previously unsupported \
					content types. The provided tools are :  \
					* mimetypes_registry (the mimetypes tool) : handle \
					mime types information \
					* portal_transform (the transform tool) : handle \
					transformation of data from a mime type to another \
					A bunch of ready to use transformations are also \
					provided. Look at the documentation for more \
					information.
