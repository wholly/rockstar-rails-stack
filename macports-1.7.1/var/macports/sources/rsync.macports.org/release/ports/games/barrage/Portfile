description	Action game with objective to destroy tanks, jeeps, etc.
long_description	Barrage is a rather violent action game with the \
			objective to kill and destroy as many targets as \
			possible within 3 minutes. You control a gun that may \
			either fire small or large grenades at soldiers, jeeps \
			and tanks. Targets are fast paced and require careful \
			aiming as it takes half a second to reload the gun. \
			Additionally you have to keep an eye on your ammo and \
			reload in time.
