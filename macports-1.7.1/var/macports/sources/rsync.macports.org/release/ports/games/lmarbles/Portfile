description             Atomix clone with slight change in concept.
long_description        LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in \
                        concept. Instead of assembling molecules you create \
                        figures out of marbles. Nevertheless, the basic game \
                        play is the same: If a marble starts to move it will \
                        not stop until it hits a wall or another marble. To \
                        make it more interesting there are obstacles like \
                        one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals. \
                        As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game you play against \
                        a move limit and not a time limit. This way you have \
                        as much time as you need to think.
