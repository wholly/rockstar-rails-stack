description		python class library for the generation of HTML documents
long_description	HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML \
				documents with Python scripts. It's used when you want to \
				create HTML pages containing information which changes from \
				time to time. For example, you might want to have a page which \
				provides an overall system summary of data collected nightly. \
				Or maybe you have a catalog of data and images that you would \
				like formed into a spiffy set of web pages for the world to \
				browse. Python is a great scripting language for these tasks \
				and with HTMLgen it is very straightforward to construct \
				objects which are rendered out into consistently structured \
				web pages. Of course, CGI scripts written in Python can take \
				advantage of these classes as well.
