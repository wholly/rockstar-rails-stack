description                     Fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python
long_description                This module implements a very fast JSON \
                                encoder/decoder for Python. \
                                \
                                JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation \
                                and is a text based lightweight data exchange \
                                format which is easy for humans to read/write \
                                and for machines to parse/generate. JSON is \
                                completely language independent and has \
                                multiple implementations in most of the \
                                programming languages, making it ideal for \
                                data exchange and storage. \
                                \
                                The module is written in C and it is up to \
                                250 times faster when compared to the other \
                                python JSON implementations which are written \
                                directly in python. This speed gain varies \
                                with the complexity of the data and the \
                                operation and is the the range of 10-200 \
                                times for encoding operations and in the \
                                range of 100-250 times for decoding operations.
