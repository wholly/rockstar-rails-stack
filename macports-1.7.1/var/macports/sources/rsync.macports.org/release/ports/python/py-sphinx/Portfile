long_description \
    Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful \
    documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of i\
    multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was \
    originally created to translate the new Python documentation, but has now \
    been cleaned up in the hope that it will be useful to many other projects.
