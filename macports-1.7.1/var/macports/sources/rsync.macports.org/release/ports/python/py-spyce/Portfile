description             pythonic server side dynamic html generation, PSP
long_description        a server-side language that supports simple and \
efficient Python-based dynamic HTML generation, otherwise called \
Python Server Pages (PSP). Those who are familiar with JSP, PHP, or \
ASP and like Python, should have a look at Spyce. Its modular design \
makes it very flexible and extensible. It can also be used as a \
command-line utility for static text pre-processing or as a \
web-server proxy.
