description		Backs up to remote directories using librsync
long_description	rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, \
			possibly over a network.  The target directory ends \
			up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse \
			diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that \
			target directory, so you can still recover files \
			lost some time ago.  The idea is to combine the best \
			features of a mirror and an incremental backup.  \
			rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard \
			links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, \
			and modification times.  Also, rdiff-backup can \
			operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, \
			like rsync.  Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to \
			securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, \
			and only the differences will be transmitted.  \
			Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings \
			have sensical defaults.
