description		provides flexible access to positional, named attributes
long_description	Python module that defines light-weight objects which \
				allow  very flexible access to a fixed number of \
				positional and named  attributes via several \
				interfaces. Or, more simply, these objects are  a \
				better way of returning the results of database \
				queries, since they  allow effcient access to fields \
				by name or by index.
