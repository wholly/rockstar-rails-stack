description		make replacement for use with python
long_description	pymake is a simple make replacement which allows the \
				specification  of file dependency graphs within \
				Python. With it, you can perform  conditional \
				complilation of source code, install software, run \
				scripts, or any repeatable sequence of tasks that ends \
				up creating a known set files on your filesystem. On \
				subsequent runs of the same set of tasks, pymake \
				performs the least amount of work possible to create \
				the same set of files, only performing the work that \
				it  detects has not already been performed by earlier \
				runs.
