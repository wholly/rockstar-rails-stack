description		Quixote is a framework for developing Web applications in Python
long_description	Quixote is a framework for developing Web applications \
				in Python. Its design goals were to allow easy \
				development of Web applications where the accent is \
				more on complicated programming logic than complicated \
				templating, to make the templating language as similar \
				to Python as possible. The aim is to make as many of \
				the skills and techniques learned from writing regular \
				Python code applicable to the task of writing Web \
				applications.
