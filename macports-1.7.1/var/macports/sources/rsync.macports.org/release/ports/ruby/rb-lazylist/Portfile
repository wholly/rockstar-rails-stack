description		        Implementation of lazy lists for ruby
long_description	    This class implements lazy lists (or streams) for Ruby. Such \
                        lists avoid the computation of values which arent needed for \
                        some computation. So its possible to define infinite lists with \
                        a limited amount of memory. A value that hasnt been used yet is \
                        calculated on the fly and saved into the list. A value which is \
                        used for a second time is computed only once and just read out \
                        of memory for the second usage.
