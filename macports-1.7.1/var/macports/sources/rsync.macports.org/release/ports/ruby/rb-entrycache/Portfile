description		A size limited hash class for ruby.
long_description    EntryCache is a size limited hash class for ruby. \
                    it features multple flushing/purging algorithms, and \
                    is very effective as a general purpose memory cache. \
                    Also provided is AdaptiveEntryCache, which adjusts and \
                    resizes automaticly based on the current cache hit/miss rate, \
                    allowing the cache to scale based on current runtime \
                    requirements. Both variants are easy to use and employ, \
                    and may serve as a drop-in replacement for \
                    Hash(as they are mainly extending it).
