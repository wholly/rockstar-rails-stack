description		    A unit testing framework for ruby.
long_description	cs/Battery is a unit testing framework for Ruby. \
                    It captures all standard error and output and reports \
                    the entire summary of all tests formatted as valid \
                    YAML, for easier reading and parsing. Another \
                    key feature is that all tests run in the order \
                    they are added to their batteries by default, but \
                    you can also re-arrange run order through the \
                    battery#tests method.
