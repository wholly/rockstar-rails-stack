description		        Framework for generating C extensions from Ruby.
long_description	    If you're starting a C extension from scratch, \
                        or if you need to dynamically generate and load \
                        C code on the fly, you may be interested. For \
                        wrapping an existing library, you should consider SWIG \
                        as well. SWIG has the advantage of being able \
                        to parse headers and generate something as a starting \
                        point. CGenerator has the advantage of automatically \
                        handling serialization and memory management, but it \
                        can handle only a limited (but extensible) range \
                        of C data types.
