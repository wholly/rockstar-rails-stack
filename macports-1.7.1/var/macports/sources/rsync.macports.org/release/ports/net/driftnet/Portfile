long_description \
		Inspired by EtherPEG, Driftnet is a program which	\
		listens to network traffic and picks out images from	\
		TCP streams it observes. Fun to run on a host which	\
		sees lots of web traffic.

#bugs		You need to have 'makedepend' in your path to build	\
#		driftnet. It usually is found in ${x11prefix}/bin.	\
#		Driftnet doesn't use a configure file, so the Makefile	\
#		has to be rudely coerced to work properly.

#user_notes	This program is lots of fun to use at a conference	\
#		where wireless networking is available. I did the port	\
#		at IETF 57 :-)
