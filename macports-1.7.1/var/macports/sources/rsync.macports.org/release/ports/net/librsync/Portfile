description	library that implements the rsync remote-delta algorithm
long_description	librsync is a free software library that implements \
		the rsync remote-delta algorithm. This algorithm allows \
		efficient remote updates of a file, without requiring the old \
		and new versions to both be present at the sending end. The \
		library uses a streaming design similar to that of zlib with \
		the aim of allowing it to be embedded into many different \
		applications. librsync is not wire-compatible with rsync 2.x, \
		and is not likely to be in the future.
