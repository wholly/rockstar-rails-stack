description	Implement Microsoft's NTLM authentication
long_description	\
	NTLM employs a challenge-response mechanism for 	\
	authentication, in which clients are able to prove 	\
	their identities without sending a password to the 	\
	server. It consists of three messages, commonly 	\
	referred to as Type 1 (negotiation), Type 2 		\
	(challenge) and Type 3 (authentication).
