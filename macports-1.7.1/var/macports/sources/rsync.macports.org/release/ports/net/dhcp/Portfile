description		ISC dhcpd server
long_description	ISC's Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution \
			reference implementation of all aspects of the DHCP \
			protocol, through a suite of DHCP tools: A DHCP \
			server, client, and relay agent.  These tools all \
			use a modular API which is designed to be sufficently \
			general that can easily be made to work on POSIX- \
			compliant operating systems and also non-POSIX \
			systems like Windows NT and Mac OS.\
			The DHCP server, client and relay agent are provided \
			both as reference implementations of the protocol \
			and as working, fully-features sample implementations.\
			Both the client and the server provide functionality \
			that, while not strictly required by the protocol, \
			is very useful in practice.  The DHCP server also \
			makes allowance for non-compliant clients which \
			one might still like to support.

NOTE:

-The dhcpd .conf and .leases files must be named and located as shown for dhcpd to find them:
	${prefix}/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf (there is a sample file)
	${prefix}/var/db/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases (use the touch command to create a blank one)
