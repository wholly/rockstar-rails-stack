description A powerful, configurable and flexible SOCKS server
long_description \
    Antinat is a flexible SOCKS server and client library for writing \
    proxy-based applications. It supports SOCKS 4, SOCKS 4a, SOCKS 5, \
    authentication, CHAP, XML firewalling, Win32, server chaining, and \
    UDP. It also contains very experimental IPv6 support.\
    SOCKS can be used to overcome some limitations of NAT, including \
    facilities for allowing connectbacks and server-side DNS. Antinat \
    aims to be fully standards compliant, feature rich, and have a solid \
    API for writing standards-compliant client applications.
