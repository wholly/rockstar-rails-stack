description       A small daemon that creates virtual hosts appearing to run various \
		  operating systems and services.

long_description  Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts (tested up to \
		  65,536 ip addresses) that can appear to be running individual operating \
		  systems and services of your choice.  Honeyd improves cyber security \
		  by providing mechanisms for threat detection and assessment, and also deters \
		  adversaries by hiding real systems in the middle of virtual systems.
