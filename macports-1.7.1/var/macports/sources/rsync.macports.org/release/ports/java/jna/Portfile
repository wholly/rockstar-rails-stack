description		Access to native shared libraries with pure Java code

long_description	Java Native Access provides Java programs easy \
			access to native shared libraries (DLLs on Windows) \
			without writing anything but Java code - no JNI or \
			native code is required.  This functionality is \
			comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's \
			ctypes.  Access is dynamic at runtime without code \
			generation.  JNA's design aims to provide native \
			access in a natural way with a minimum of effort.  \
			No boilerplate or generated code is required.  While \
			some attention is paid to performance, correctness \
			and ease of use take priority.
