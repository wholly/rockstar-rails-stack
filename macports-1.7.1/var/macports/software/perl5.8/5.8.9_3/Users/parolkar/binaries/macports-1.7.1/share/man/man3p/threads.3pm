.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Perl 5.6 introduced something called interpreter threads.  Interpreter threads
are different from \fI5005threads\fR (the thread model of Perl 5.005) by creating
a new Perl interpreter per thread, and not sharing any data or state between
threads by default.
.PP
Prior to Perl 5.8, this has only been available to people embedding Perl, and
for emulating \fIfork()\fR on Windows.
.PP
The \fIthreads\fR \s-1API\s0 is loosely based on the old Thread.pm \s-1API\s0. It is very
important to note that variables are not shared between threads, all variables
are by default thread local.  To use shared variables one must also use
threads::shared:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use threads;
\&    use threads::shared;
.Ve
.PP
It is also important to note that you must enable threads by doing \f(CW\*(C`use
threads\*(C'\fR as early as possible in the script itself, and that it is not
possible to enable threading inside an \f(CW\*(C`eval ""\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR.  In particular, if you are intending to share variables with
threads::shared, you must \f(CW\*(C`use threads\*(C'\fR before you \f(CW\*(C`use threads::shared\*(C'\fR.
(\f(CW\*(C`threads\*(C'\fR will emit a warning if you do it the other way around.)
.IP "$thr = threads\->create(\s-1FUNCTION\s0, \s-1ARGS\s0)" 4
.IX Item "$thr = threads->create(FUNCTION, ARGS)"
This will create a new thread that will begin execution with the specified
entry point function, and give it the \fI\s-1ARGS\s0\fR list as parameters.  It will
return the corresponding threads object, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if thread creation failed.
.Sp
\&\fI\s-1FUNCTION\s0\fR may either be the name of a function, an anonymous subroutine, or
a code ref.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my $thr = threads->create('func_name', ...);
\&        # or
\&    my $thr = threads->create(sub { ... }, ...);
\&        # or
\&    my $thr = threads->create(\e&func, ...);
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\->new()\*(C'\fR method is an alias for \f(CW\*(C`\->create()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "$thr\->\fIjoin()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->join()"
This will wait for the corresponding thread to complete its execution.  When
the thread finishes, \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR will return the return value(s) of the
entry point function.
.Sp
The context (void, scalar or list) for the return value(s) for \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR
is determined at the time of thread creation.
.Sp
.Vb 13

.Sp
See \*(L"\s-1THREAD\s0 \s-1CONTEXT\s0\*(R" for more details.
.Sp
If the program exits without all threads having either been joined or
detached, then a warning will be issued.
.Sp
Calling \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\->detach()\*(C'\fR on an already joined thread will
cause an error to be thrown.
.IP "$thr\->\fIdetach()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->detach()"
Makes the thread unjoinable, and causes any eventual return value to be
discarded.  When the program exits, any detached threads that are still
running are silently terminated.
.Sp
If the program exits without all threads having either been joined or
detached, then a warning will be issued.
.Sp
Calling \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\->detach()\*(C'\fR on an already detached thread
will cause an error to be thrown.
.IP "threads\->\fIdetach()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->detach()"
Class method that allows a thread to detach itself.
.IP "threads\->\fIself()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->self()"
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own \fIthreads\fR object.
.IP "$thr\->\fItid()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->tid()"
Returns the \s-1ID\s0 of the thread.  Thread IDs are unique integers with the main
thread in a program being 0, and incrementing by 1 for every thread created.
.IP "threads\->\fItid()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->tid()"
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own \s-1ID\s0.
.ie n .IP """$thr""" 4
.el .IP "``$thr''" 4
.IX Item "$thr"
If you add the \f(CW\*(C`stringify\*(C'\fR import option to your \f(CW\*(C`use threads\*(C'\fR declaration,
then using a threads object in a string or a string context (e.g., as a hash
key) will cause its \s-1ID\s0 to be used as the value:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use threads qw(stringify);
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $thr = threads->create(...);
\&    print("Thread $thr started...\en");  # Prints out: Thread 1 started...
.Ve
.IP "threads\->object($tid)" 4
.IX Item "threads->object($tid)"
This will return the \fIthreads\fR object for the \fIactive\fR thread associated
with the specified thread \s-1ID\s0.  Returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if there is no thread
associated with the \s-1TID\s0, if the thread is joined or detached, if no \s-1TID\s0 is
specified or if the specified \s-1TID\s0 is undef.
.IP "threads\->\fIyield()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->yield()"
This is a suggestion to the \s-1OS\s0 to let this thread yield \s-1CPU\s0 time to other
threads.  What actually happens is highly dependent upon the underlying
thread implementation.
.Sp
You may do \f(CW\*(C`use threads qw(yield)\*(C'\fR, and then just use \f(CW\*(C`yield()\*(C'\fR in your
code.
.IP "threads\->\fIlist()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->list()"
.PD 0
.IP "threads\->list(threads::all)" 4

.IP "threads\->list(threads::running)" 4
.IX Item "threads->list(threads::running)"
.IP "threads\->list(threads::joinable)" 4
.IX Item "threads->list(threads::joinable)"
.PD
With no arguments (or using \f(CW\*(C`threads::all\*(C'\fR) and in a list context, returns a
list of all non\-joined, non-detached \fIthreads\fR objects.  In a scalar context,
returns a count of the same.
.Sp
With a \fItrue\fR argument (using \f(CW\*(C`threads::running\*(C'\fR), returns a list of all
non\-joined, non-detached \fIthreads\fR objects that are still running.
.Sp
With a \fIfalse\fR argument (using \f(CW\*(C`threads::joinable\*(C'\fR), returns a list of all
non\-joined, non-detached \fIthreads\fR objects that have finished running (i.e.,
for which \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR will not \fIblock\fR).
.IP "$thr1\->equal($thr2)" 4
.IX Item "$thr1->equal($thr2)"
Tests if two threads objects are the same thread or not.  This is overloaded
to the more natural forms:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    if ($thr1 == $thr2) {
\&        print("Threads are the same\en");
\&    }
\&    # or
\&    if ($thr1 != $thr2) {
\&        print("Threads differ\en");
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
(Thread comparison is based on thread IDs.)
.IP "async \s-1BLOCK\s0;" 4
.IX Item "async BLOCK;"
\&\f(CW\*(C`async\*(C'\fR creates a thread to execute the block immediately following
it.  This block is treated as an anonymous subroutine, and so must have a
semicolon after the closing brace.  Like \f(CW\*(C`threads\->create()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`async\*(C'\fR
returns a \fIthreads\fR object.
.IP "$thr\->\fIerror()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->error()"
Threads are executed in an \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR context.  This method will return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
if the thread terminates \fInormally\fR.  Otherwise, it returns the value of
\&\f(CW$@\fR associated with the thread's execution status in its \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR context.
.IP "$thr\->\fI_handle()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->_handle()"
This \fIprivate\fR method returns the memory location of the internal thread
structure associated with a threads object.  For Win32, this is a pointer to
the \f(CW\*(C`HANDLE\*(C'\fR value returned by \f(CW\*(C`CreateThread\*(C'\fR (i.e., \f(CW\*(C`HANDLE *\*(C'\fR); for other
platforms, it is a pointer to the \f(CW\*(C`pthread_t\*(C'\fR structure used in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`pthread_create\*(C'\fR call (i.e., \f(CW\*(C`pthread_t *\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
This method is of no use for general Perl threads programming.  Its intent is
to provide other (XS\-based) thread modules with the capability to access, and
possibly manipulate, the underlying thread structure associated with a Perl
thread.
.IP "threads\->\fI_handle()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->_handle()"
Class method that allows a thread to obtain its own \fIhandle\fR.
.SH "EXITING A THREAD"
.IX Header "EXITING A THREAD"
The usual method for terminating a thread is to
\&\fIreturn()\fR from the entry point function with the
appropriate return value(s).
.IP "threads\->\fIexit()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->exit()"
If needed, a thread can be exited at any time by calling
\&\f(CW\*(C`threads\->exit()\*(C'\fR.  This will cause the thread to return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR in a
scalar context, or the empty list in a list context.
.Sp
When called from the \fImain\fR thread, this behaves the same as \f(CWexit(0)\fR.
.IP "threads\->exit(status)" 4
.IX Item "threads->exit(status)"
When called from a thread, this behaves like \f(CW\*(C`threads\->exit()\*(C'\fR (i.e., the
exit status code is ignored).
.Sp
When called from the \fImain\fR thread, this behaves the same as \f(CW\*(C`exit(status)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fIdie()\fR" 4
.IX Item "die()"
Calling \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR in a thread indicates an abnormal exit for the thread.  Any
\&\f(CW$SIG{_\|_DIE_\|_}\fR handler in the thread will be called first, and then the
thread will exit with a warning message that will contain any arguments passed
in the \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR call.
.IP "exit(status)" 4
.IX Item "exit(status)"
Calling \fIexit()\fR inside a thread causes the whole
application to terminate.  Because of this, the use of \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR inside
threaded code, or in modules that might be used in threaded applications, is
strongly discouraged.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR really is needed, then consider using the following:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    threads->exit() if threads->can('exit');   # Thread friendly
\&    exit(status);
.Ve
.IP "use threads 'exit' => 'threads_only'" 4
.IX Item "use threads 'exit' => 'threads_only'"
This globally overrides the default behavior of calling \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR inside a
thread, and effectively causes such calls to behave the same as
\&\f(CW\*(C`threads\->exit()\*(C'\fR.  In other words, with this setting, calling \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR
causes only the thread to terminate.
.Sp
Because of its global effect, this setting should not be used inside modules
or the like.
.Sp
The \fImain\fR thread is unaffected by this setting.
.IP "threads\->create({'exit' => 'thread_only'}, ...)" 4
.IX Item "threads->create({'exit' => 'thread_only'}, ...)"
This overrides the default behavior of \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR inside the newly created
thread only.
.IP "$thr\->set_thread_exit_only(boolean)" 4
.IX Item "$thr->set_thread_exit_only(boolean)"
This can be used to change the \fIexit thread only\fR behavior for a thread after
it has been created.  With a \fItrue\fR argument, \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR will cause only the
thread to exit.  With a \fIfalse\fR argument, \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR will terminate the
application.
.Sp
The \fImain\fR thread is unaffected by this call.
.IP "threads\->set_thread_exit_only(boolean)" 4
.IX Item "threads->set_thread_exit_only(boolean)"
Class method for use inside a thread to change its own behavior for \f(CW\*(C`exit()\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \fImain\fR thread is unaffected by this call.
.SH "THREAD STATE"
.IX Header "THREAD STATE"
The following boolean methods are useful in determining the \fIstate\fR of a
thread.
.IP "$thr\->\fIis_running()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->is_running()"
Returns true if a thread is still running (i.e., if its entry point function
has not yet finished or exited).
.IP "$thr\->\fIis_joinable()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->is_joinable()"
Returns true if the thread has finished running, is not detached and has not
yet been joined.  In other words, the thread is ready to be joined, and a call
to \f(CW\*(C`$thr\->join()\*(C'\fR will not \fIblock\fR.
.IP "$thr\->\fIis_detached()\fR" 4
.IX Item "$thr->is_detached()"
Returns true if the thread has been detached.
.IP "threads\->\fIis_detached()\fR" 4
.IX Item "threads->is_detached()"
Class method that allows a thread to determine whether or not it is detached.
.SH "THREAD CONTEXT"
.IX Header "THREAD CONTEXT"
As with subroutines, the type of value returned from a thread's entry point
function may be determined by the thread's \fIcontext\fR:  list, scalar or void.
The thread's context is determined at thread creation.  This is necessary so
that the context is available to the entry point function via
\&\fIwantarray()\fR.  The thread may then specify a value of
the appropriate type to be returned from \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "Explicit context"
.IX Subsection "Explicit context"
Because thread creation and thread joining may occur in different contexts, it
may be desirable to state the context explicitly to the thread's entry point
function.  This may be done by calling \f(CW\*(C`\->create()\*(C'\fR with a hash reference
as the first argument:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $thr = threads->create({'context' => 'list'}, \e&foo);
\&    ...
\&    my @results = $thr->join();
.Ve
.PP
In the above, the threads object is returned to the parent thread in scalar
context, and the thread's entry point function \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR will be called in list
(array) context such that the parent thread can receive a list (array) from
the \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR call.  (\f(CW'array'\fR is synonymous with \f(CW'list'\fR.)
.PP
Similarly, if you need the threads object, but your thread will not be
returning a value (i.e., \fIvoid\fR context), you would do the following:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $thr = threads->create({'context' => 'void'}, \e&foo);
\&    ...
\&    $thr->join();
.Ve
.PP
The context type may also be used as the \fIkey\fR in the hash reference followed
by a \fItrue\fR value:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    threads->create({'scalar' => 1}, \e&foo);
\&    ...
\&    my ($thr) = threads->list();
\&    my $result = $thr->join();
.Ve
.Sh "Implicit context"
.IX Subsection "Implicit context"
If not explicitly stated, the thread's context is implied from the context
of the \f(CW\*(C`\->create()\*(C'\fR call:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Create thread in list context
\&    my ($thr) = threads->create(...);
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Create thread in scalar context
\&    my $thr = threads->create(...);
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Create thread in void context
\&    threads->create(...);
.Ve
.Sh "$thr\->\fIwantarray()\fP"
.IX Subsection "$thr->wantarray()"
This returns the thread's context in the same manner as
\&\fIwantarray()\fR.
.Sh "threads\->\fIwantarray()\fP"
.IX Subsection "threads->wantarray()"
Class method to return the current thread's context.  This returns the same
value as running \fIwantarray()\fR inside the current
thread's entry point function.
.SH "THREAD STACK SIZE"
.IX Header "THREAD STACK SIZE"
The default per-thread stack size for different platforms varies
significantly, and is almost always far more than is needed for most
applications.  On Win32, Perl's makefile explicitly sets the default stack to
16 \s-1MB\s0; on most other platforms, the system default is used, which again may be
much larger than is needed.
.PP
By tuning the stack size to more accurately reflect your application's needs,
you may significantly reduce your application's memory usage, and increase the
number of simultaneously running threads.
.PP
Note that on Windows, address space allocation granularity is 64 \s-1KB\s0,
therefore, setting the stack smaller than that on Win32 Perl will not save any
more memory.
.IP "threads\->\fIget_stack_size()\fR;" 4
.IX Item "threads->get_stack_size();"
Returns the current default per-thread stack size.  The default is zero, which
means the system default stack size is currently in use.
.ie n .IP "$size = $thr\fR\->\fIget_stack_size();" 4
.el .IP "$size = \f(CW$thr\fR\->\fIget_stack_size()\fR;" 4
.IX Item "$size = $thr->get_stack_size();"
Returns the stack size for a particular thread.  A return value of zero
indicates the system default stack size was used for the thread.
.IP "$old_size = threads\->set_stack_size($new_size);" 4
.IX Item "$old_size = threads->set_stack_size($new_size);"
Sets a new default per-thread stack size, and returns the previous setting.
.Sp
Some platforms have a minimum thread stack size.  Trying to set the stack size
below this value will result in a warning, and the minimum stack size will be
used.
.Sp
Some Linux platforms have a maximum stack size.  Setting too large of a stack
size will cause thread creation to fail.
.Sp
If needed, \f(CW$new_size\fR will be rounded up to the next multiple of the memory
page size (usually 4096 or 8192).
.Sp
Threads created after the stack size is set will then either call
\&\f(CW\*(C`pthread_attr_setstacksize()\*(C'\fR \fI(for pthreads platforms)\fR, or supply the
stack size to \f(CW\*(C`CreateThread()\*(C'\fR \fI(for Win32 Perl)\fR.
.Sp
(Obviously, this call does not affect any currently extant threads.)
.IP "use threads ('stack_size' => \s-1VALUE\s0);" 4
.IX Item "use threads ('stack_size' => VALUE);"
This sets the default per-thread stack size at the start of the application.
.IP "$ENV{'\s-1PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE\s0'}" 4
.IX Item "$ENV{'PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE'}"
The default per-thread stack size may be set at the start of the application
through the use of the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE=1048576
\&    export PERL5_ITHREADS_STACK_SIZE
\&    perl -e'use threads; print(threads->get_stack_size(), "\en")'
.Ve
.Sp
This value overrides any \f(CW\*(C`stack_size\*(C'\fR parameter given to \f(CW\*(C`use threads\*(C'\fR.  Its
primary purpose is to permit setting the per-thread stack size for legacy
threaded applications.
.IP "threads\->create({'stack_size' => \s-1VALUE\s0}, \s-1FUNCTION\s0, \s-1ARGS\s0)" 4
.IX Item "threads->create({'stack_size' => VALUE}, FUNCTION, ARGS)"
To specify a particular stack size for any individual thread, call
\&\f(CW\*(C`\->create()\*(C'\fR with a hash reference as the first argument:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $thr = threads->create({'stack_size' => 32*4096}, \e&foo, @args);
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$thr2 = $thr1\->create(\s-1FUNCTION\s0, \s-1ARGS\s0)" 4
.el .IP "$thr2 = \f(CW$thr1\fR\->create(\s-1FUNCTION\s0, \s-1ARGS\s0)" 4
.IX Item "$thr2 = $thr1->create(FUNCTION, ARGS)"
This creates a new thread (\f(CW$thr2\fR) that inherits the stack size from an
existing thread (\f(CW$thr1\fR).  This is shorthand for the following:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $stack_size = $thr1->get_stack_size();
\&    my $thr2 = threads->create({'stack_size' => $stack_size}, FUNCTION, ARGS);
.Ve
.SH "THREAD SIGNALLING"
.IX Header "THREAD SIGNALLING"
When safe signals is in effect (the default behavior \- see \*(L"Unsafe signals\*(R"
for more details), then signals may be sent and acted upon by individual
threads.
.IP "$thr\->kill('\s-1SIG\s0...');" 4
.IX Item "$thr->kill('SIG...');"
Sends the specified signal to the thread.  Signal names and (positive) signal
numbers are the same as those supported by
\&\fIkill()\fR.  For example, '\s-1SIGTERM\s0', '\s-1TERM\s0' and
(depending on the \s-1OS\s0) 15 are all valid arguments to \f(CW\*(C`\->kill()\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Returns the thread object to allow for method chaining:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $thr->kill('SIG...')->join();
.Ve
.PP
Signal handlers need to be set up in the threads for the signals they are
expected to act upon.  Here's an example for \fIcancelling\fR a thread:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use threads;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub thr_func
\&    {
\&        # Thread 'cancellation' signal handler
\&        $SIG{'KILL'} = sub { threads->exit(); };
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Create a thread
\&    my $thr = threads->create('thr_func');
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ...
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # Signal the thread to terminate, and then detach
\&    # it so that it will get cleaned up automatically
\&    $thr->kill('KILL')->detach();
.Ve
.PP
Here's another simplistic example that illustrates the use of thread
signalling in conjunction with a semaphore to provide rudimentary \fIsuspend\fR
and \fIresume\fR capabilities:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use threads;
\&    use Thread::Semaphore;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    sub thr_func
\&    {
\&        my $sema = shift;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        # Thread 'suspend/resume' signal handler
\&        $SIG{'STOP'} = sub {
\&            $sema->down();      # Thread suspended
\&            $sema->up();        # Thread resumes
\&        };
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # Create a semaphore and pass it to a thread
\&    my $sema = Thread::Semaphore->new();
\&    my $thr = threads->create('thr_func', $sema);
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # Suspend the thread
\&    $sema->down();
\&    $thr->kill('STOP');
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ...
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Allow the thread to continue
\&    $sema->up();
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1CAVEAT:\s0  The thread signalling capability provided by this module does not
actually send signals via the \s-1OS\s0.  It \fIemulates\fR signals at the Perl-level
such that signal handlers are called in the appropriate thread.  For example,
sending \f(CW\*(C`$thr\->kill('STOP')\*(C'\fR does not actually suspend a thread (or the
whole process), but does cause a \f(CW$SIG{'STOP'}\fR handler to be called in that
thread (as illustrated above).
.PP
As such, signals that would normally not be appropriate to use in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`kill()\*(C'\fR command (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`kill('KILL', $$)\*(C'\fR) are okay to use with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\->kill()\*(C'\fR method (again, as illustrated above).
.PP
Correspondingly, sending a signal to a thread does not disrupt the operation
the thread is currently working on:  The signal will be acted upon after the
current operation has completed.  For instance, if the thread is \fIstuck\fR on
an I/O call, sending it a signal will not cause the I/O call to be interrupted
such that the signal is acted up immediately.
.PP
Sending a signal to a terminated thread is ignored.

Unfortunately, you may encounter Perl modules that are not \fIthread-safe\fR.
For example, they may crash the Perl interpreter during execution, or may dump
core on termination.  Depending on the module and the requirements of your

If the module will only be used inside a thread, you can try loading the

.IP "Current working directory" 4
.IX Item "Current working directory"
On all platforms except MSWin32, the setting for the current working directory
is shared among all threads such that changing it in one thread (e.g., using

.Sp
On MSWin32, each thread maintains its own the current working directory

.IP "Environment variables" 4
.IX Item "Environment variables"
Currently, on all platforms except MSWin32, all \fIsystem\fR calls (e.g., using
\&\f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR or back\-ticks) made from threads use the environment variable
settings from the \fImain\fR thread.  In other words, changes made to \f(CW%ENV\fR in
a thread will not be visible in \fIsystem\fR calls made by that thread.
.Sp
To work around this, set environment variables as part of the \fIsystem\fR call.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my $msg = 'hello';

Creating threads inside \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`CHECK\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`INIT\*(C'\fR blocks should not be

Returning objects from threads does not work.  Depending on the classes

.IP "\s-1END\s0 blocks in threads" 4
.IX Item "END blocks in threads"
It is possible to add \s-1END\s0 blocks to threads by using require or

during a \f(CW\*(C`\->join()\*(C'\fR call, or at program termination).
.Sp
However, calling any threads methods in such an \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR block will most
likely \fIfail\fR (e.g., the application may hang, or generate an error) due to
mutexes that are needed to control functionality within the threads module.

discouraged.
.IP "Perl Bugs and the \s-1CPAN\s0 Version of threads" 4

Support for threads extends beyond the code in this module (i.e.,

latest version of threads from \s-1CPAN\s0.  There is no workaround for this other
than upgrading to the latest version of Perl.
