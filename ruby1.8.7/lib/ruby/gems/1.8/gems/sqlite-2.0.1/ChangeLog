	* sqlite.gemspec: Added doc directory to gemspec.

2004-09-10 11:42  minam

	* ChangeLog, README, ext/sqlite-api.c: Removed ChangeLog (in favor
	  of using cvs2cl tool). Bumped version number in sqlite-api.c.
	  Added link to FAQ in README.

2004-09-10 11:36  minam

	* ChangeLog, sqlite.gemspec, doc/faq/faq.rb, doc/faq/faq.yml,
	  lib/sqlite/parsed_statement.rb, test/tc_database.rb: Added a FAQ
	  in lieu of "real" documentation. Added comment support in parsed
	  statement. Version bump in gemspec.

2004-09-09 23:06  minam

	* ext/extconf.rb, ext/sqlite-api.c, lib/sqlite/database.rb,
	  lib/sqlite/parsed_statement.rb, lib/sqlite/resultset.rb,
	  lib/sqlite/statement.rb, test/tc_api_core.rb,
	  test/tc_parsed_statement.rb: Removed all of the "experimental"
	  functions. Replaced "bind" with a much richer suite of
	  functionality implemented in Ruby (SQLite::ParsedStatement).
	  Unit tests all pass.

2004-09-09 15:47  minam

	* ext/: extconf.rb, sqlite-api.c: Check for existence of the
	  "experimental" functions, and only implement the wrappers for
	  them if they exist. Also, removed dependency on unistd.h and
	  sleep().

2004-09-09 12:40  minam

	* sqlite.gemspec, ext/sqlite-api.c, lib/sqlite/database.rb,
	  lib/sqlite/pragmas.rb, lib/sqlite/statement.rb,
	  test/tc_api_core.rb, test/tc_database.rb, test/tc_pragmas.rb:
	  Moved all exceptions to an "Exceptions" module. Updated code to
	  reflect the move, and added a test case to check for
	  MisuseException when accessing aggregate methods from
	  non-aggregate functions.

2004-09-09 10:12  minam

	* README, test/tc_api_core.rb, test/tc_arrayfields.rb,
	  test/tc_database.rb, test/tc_pragmas.rb, test/tc_translator.rb,
	  test/tc_type_translation.rb, test/tests.rb: Tests now build their
	  own up-to-date copy of the extension library, like they used to.

2004-09-09 09:44  minam

	* ext/sqlite-api.c, lib/sqlite/pragmas.rb: Finished documentation.

2004-09-08 22:48  minam

	* ext/sqlite-api.c, lib/sqlite/database.rb,
	  lib/sqlite/resultset.rb, lib/sqlite/statement.rb,
	  lib/sqlite/translator.rb, test/tc_database.rb: Added RDoc
	  documentation.

	  test/db/fixtures.sql: Version 2.0.0 -- initial check in. Complete
	  rewrite to get away from callback oriented queries. Now using the
	  "sqlite_compile" API for doing queries, which is a bit
	  friendlier.

2004-07-29 08:54  minam

	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog.

2004-07-29 08:53  minam

	* sqlite.gemspec, ext/sqlite.c, test/test_db.rb: Version bump. Also
	  added constant to SQLite module for querying the version of this
	  extension library.

2004-07-13 12:09  minam

	* TODO: TODO for version 2.0

2004-07-13 10:49  minam

	* ChangeLog, ext/sqlite.c, test/test_arrayfields.rb: Added Ara's
	  patch for better ArrayFields integration. Also added a unit test
	  for testing ArrayFields integration, if 'arrayfields' can be
	  loaded.

2004-07-11 14:46  minam

	* sqlite.gemspec: Version bump. Looks like the pre-release was
	  stable enough to work with.

2004-07-03 19:21  minam

	* sqlite.gemspec: Added requirement that Ruby version be at least
	  1.8.0.

2004-07-03 16:11  minam

	* ChangeLog, ext/sqlite.c, lib/sqlite.rb, test/test_db.rb,
	  test/test_errors.rb, test/test_serialize.rb: Added 'quote',
	  'decode', and 'encode' methods on the Database class. Also added
	  exception classes for each valid return code from the sqlite API.
	  Updated test cases.

2004-07-03 12:59  minam

	* README: Changed important notice.

2004-07-03 12:54  minam

	* ChangeLog, sqlite.gemspec, ext/sqlite.c, test/test_results.rb:
	  Removed explicit dependency on arrayfields, and instead made it
	  optional to have rows returned as arrays instead of hashes. This
	  allows arrayfields to be used, but not required by the library.
	  Updated version number to prepare for 1.3.0.

2004-07-01 10:34  minam

	* README: Added notice regarding the change in column indexing.

2004-07-01 10:30  minam

	* ChangeLog: Updated the changelog.

2004-07-01 10:29  minam

	* sqlite.gemspec, test/tests.rb: Brought gemspec into the modern
	  age (added rdoc and test suite support). Made tests.rb so it can
	  be run from any directory, instead of requiring that it be
	  executed from the test directory.

2004-07-01 09:15  minam

	* test/test_results.rb: Test case for verifying the correct
	  behavior of the hash-based and arrayfields-based result sets.

2004-07-01 09:14  minam

	* ChangeLog, sqlite.gemspec, ext/sqlite.c, lib/sqlite.rb,
	  test/test_types.rb: Result set columns are now indexed from 0
	  instead of 1. Also, if the 'arrayfields' module is installed, it
	  will be used by default for returning result set rows, instead of
	  a hash. Also fixed all samples and tests to use the 0-based index
	  for columns.

2004-06-30 15:30  minam

	* install.rb: The install.rb script now passes all parameters to
	  the extconf.rb script, so that customized installations may be
	  accomplished.

2004-06-02 09:18  minam

	* test/test_types.rb: Added test case for NULL boolean columns.

2004-05-25 16:19  minam

	* ChangeLog: A. Howard's patch for extconf.rb

2004-05-25 16:12  minam

	* ext/extconf.rb: Patch from Ara Howard to allow compiling of the
	  module when SQLite is installed in a non-standard location.

2004-05-20 07:20  minam

	* sqlite.gemspec: Version number bump.

2004-05-17 08:01  minam

	* ChangeLog: Updated ChangeLog

2004-05-17 07:59  minam

	* ext/sqlite.c: Changed how the version and encoding are obtained,
	  since in Windows you have to call a function (can't refer to an
	  exported constant, I guess).

2004-05-12 10:30  minam

	* sqlite.gemspec: Version number bump.

2004-05-12 10:22  minam

	* ChangeLog, ext/sqlite.c, lib/sqlite.rb, test/test_db.rb,
	  test/test_fn.rb, test/test_pragmas.rb, test/test_types.rb,
	  test/tests.rb: Added test cases. Fixed bugs (boolean
	  type-translation flip-flop, missing "open" alias for
	  "Database#new", problem with NULL handling when type-translation
	  was on). Refactored the pragma methods in Database to make them
	  more consistent.

2004-05-11 17:04  minam

	* ChangeLog: Forgot to update ChangeLog...

2004-05-11 16:57  minam

	* README, sqlite.gemspec, ext/sqlite.c: Apparently, the metadata
	  columns do not have types. This caused pragma queries to crash
	  when show_datatypes was turned on. Metadata columns now have
	  their types reported as "STRING".

2004-05-11 11:25  minam

	* install.rb: Had one copy line in there twice. Oops.
