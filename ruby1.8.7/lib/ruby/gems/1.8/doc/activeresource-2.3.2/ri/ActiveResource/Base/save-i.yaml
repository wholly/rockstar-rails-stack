  body: A method to \save (<tt>POST</tt>) or \update (<tt>PUT</tt>) a resource. It delegates to <tt>create</tt> if a \new object, <tt>update</tt> if it is existing. If the response to the \save includes a body, it will be assumed that this body is XML for the final object as it looked after the \save (which would include attributes like <tt>created_at</tt> that weren't part of the original submit).
