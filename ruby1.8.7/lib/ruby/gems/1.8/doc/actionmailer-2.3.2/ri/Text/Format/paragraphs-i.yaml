  body: Considers each element of text (provided or internal) as a paragraph. If <tt>#first_indent</tt> is the same as <tt>#body_indent</tt>, then paragraphs will be separated by a single empty line in the result; otherwise, the paragraphs will follow immediately after each other. Uses <tt>#format</tt> to do the heavy lifting.
