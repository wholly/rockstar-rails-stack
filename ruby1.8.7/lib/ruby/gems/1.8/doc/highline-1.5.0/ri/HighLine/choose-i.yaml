  body: This method is HighLine's menu handler. For simple usage, you can just pass all the menu items you wish to display. At that point, choose() will build and display a menu, walk the user through selection, and return their choice amoung the provided items. You might use this in a case statement for quick and dirty menus.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: However, choose() is capable of much more. If provided, a block will be passed a HighLine::Menu object to configure. Using this method, you can customize all the details of menu handling from index display, to building a complete shell-like menuing system. See HighLine::Menu for all the methods it responds to.
