    label: "<tt>:columns_across</tt>:"
    body: <em>items</em> will be placed in columns, flowing from left to right. If given, <em>option</em> is the number of columns to be used. When absent, columns will be determined based on <em>wrap_at</em> or a default of 80 characters.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "<tt>:columns_down</tt>:"

  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI

    body: The default mode. Each of the <em>items</em> is placed on it's own line. The <em>option</em> parameter is ignored in this mode.
  type: :NOTE
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Each member of the <em>items</em> Array is passed through ERb and thus can contain their own expansions. Color escape expansions do not contribute to the final field width.
