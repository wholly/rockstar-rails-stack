- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Adds <em>name</em> to the list of available menu items. Menu items will be displayed in the order they are added.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: An optional <em>action</em> can be associated with this name and if provided, it will be called if the item is selected. The result of the method will be returned, unless <em>nil_on_handled</em> is set (when you would get <tt>nil</tt> instead). In <em>shell</em> mode, a provided block will be passed the command chosen and any details that followed the command. Otherwise, just the command is passed. The <tt>@highline</tt> variable is set to the current HighLine context before the action code is called and can thus be used for adding output and the like.
