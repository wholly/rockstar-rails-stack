- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Create a series of SAX-like XML events (e.g. start_tag, end_tag) from the markup code. XmlEvent objects are used in a way similar to XmlMarkup objects, except that a series of events are generated and passed to a handler rather than generating character-based markup.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Usage:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  xe = Builder::XmlEvents.new(handler)\n  xe.title(&quot;HI&quot;)    # Sends start_tag/end_tag/text messages to the handler.\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Indentation may also be selected by providing value for the indentation size and initial indentation level.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  xe = Builder::XmlEvents.new(handler, indent_size, initial_indent_level)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::H

  text: XML Event Handler
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The handler object must expect the following events.
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: <tt>start_tag(tag, attrs)</tt>
    body: Announces that a new tag has been found. <tt>tag</tt> is the name of the tag and <tt>attrs</tt> is a hash of attributes for the tag.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: <tt>end_tag(tag)</tt>
    body: Announces that an end tag for <tt>tag</tt> has been found.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: <tt>text(text)</tt>
    body: Announces that a string of characters (<tt>text</tt>) has been found. A series of characters may be broken up into more than one <tt>text</tt> call, so the client cannot assume that a single callback contains all the text data.
