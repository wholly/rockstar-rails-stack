  body: "Check-out a database connection from the pool, indicating that you want to use it. You should call #checkin when you no longer need this."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "This is done by either returning an existing connection, or by creating a new connection. If the maximum number of connections for this pool has already been reached, but the pool is empty (i.e. they're all being used), then this method will wait until a thread has checked in a connection. The wait time is bounded however: if no connection can be checked out within the timeout specified for this pool, then a ConnectionTimeoutError exception will be raised."
