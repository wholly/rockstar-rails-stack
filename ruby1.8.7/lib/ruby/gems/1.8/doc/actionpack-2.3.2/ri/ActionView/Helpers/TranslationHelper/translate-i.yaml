- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Delegates to I18n#translate but also performs two additional functions. First, it'll catch MissingTranslationData exceptions and turn them into inline spans that contains the missing key, such that you can see in a view what is missing where.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Second, it'll scope the key by the current partial if the key starts with a period. So if you call translate(&quot;.foo&quot;) from the people/index.html.erb template, you'll actually be calling I18n.translate(&quot;people.index.foo&quot;). This makes it less repetitive to translate many keys within the same partials and gives you a simple framework for scoping them consistently. If you don't prepend the key with a period, nothing is converted.
