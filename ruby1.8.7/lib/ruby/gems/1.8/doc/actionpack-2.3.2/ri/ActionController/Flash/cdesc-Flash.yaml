  body: "The flash provides a way to pass temporary objects between actions. Anything you place in the flash will be exposed to the very next action and then cleared out. This is a great way of doing notices and alerts, such as a create action that sets <tt>flash[:notice] = &quot;Successfully created&quot;</tt> before redirecting to a display action that can then expose the flash to its template. Actually, that exposure is automatically done. Example:"

  body: "  class PostsController &lt; ActionController::Base\n    def create\n      # save post\n      flash[:notice] = &quot;Successfully created post&quot;\n      redirect_to posts_path(@post)\n    end\n\n    def show\n      # doesn't need to assign the flash notice to the template, that's done automatically\n    end\n  end\n\n  show.html.erb\n    &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;\n      &lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;&lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\n"

  body: "This example just places a string in the flash, but you can put any object in there. And of course, you can put as many as you like at a time too. Just remember: They'll be gone by the time the next action has been performed."
