  body: Attempts to render a static error page based on the <tt>status_code</tt> thrown, or just return headers if no such file exists. At first, it will try to render a localized static page. For example, if a 500 error is being handled Rails and locale is :da, it will first attempt to render the file at <tt>public/500.da.html</tt> then attempt to render <tt>public/500.html</tt>. If none of them exist, the body of the response will be left empty.
