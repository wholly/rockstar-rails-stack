- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: An assertion that selects elements and makes one or more equality tests.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If the first argument is an element, selects all matching elements starting from (and including) that element and all its children in depth-first order.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If no element if specified, calling <tt>assert_select</tt> selects from the response HTML unless <tt>assert_select</tt> is called from within an <tt>assert_select</tt> block.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When called with a block <tt>assert_select</tt> passes an array of selected elements to the block. Calling <tt>assert_select</tt> from the block, with no element specified, runs the assertion on the complete set of elements selected by the enclosing assertion. Alternatively the array may be iterated through so that <tt>assert_select</tt> can be called separately for each element.

  text: Example
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If the response contains two ordered lists, each with four list elements then:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  assert_select &quot;ol&quot; do |elements|\n    elements.each do |element|\n      assert_select element, &quot;li&quot;, 4\n    end\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "will pass, as will:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  assert_select &quot;ol&quot; do\n    assert_select &quot;li&quot;, 8\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The selector may be a CSS selector expression (String), an expression with substitution values, or an HTML::Selector object.

  text: Equality Tests
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The equality test may be one of the following:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>true</tt> - Assertion is true if at least one element selected.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>false</tt> - Assertion is true if no element selected.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>String/Regexp</tt> - Assertion is true if the text value of at least one element matches the string or regular expression.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Integer</tt> - Assertion is true if exactly that number of elements are selected.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Range</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements fit the range.
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If no equality test specified, the assertion is true if at least one element selected.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "To perform more than one equality tests, use a hash with the following keys:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:text</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this text value (string or regexp).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:html</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this HTML content (string or regexp).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:count</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is equal to this value.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:minimum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is at least this value.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:maximum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is at most this value.
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If the method is called with a block, once all equality tests are evaluated the block is called with an array of all matched elements.
