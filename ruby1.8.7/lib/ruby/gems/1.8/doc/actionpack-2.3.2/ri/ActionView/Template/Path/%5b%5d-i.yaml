  body: Returns a ActionView::Template object for the given path string. The input path should be relative to the view path directory, +hello/index.html.erb+. This method also has a special exception to match partial file names without a handler extension. So +hello/index.html+ will match the first template it finds with a known template extension, +hello/index.html.erb+. Template extensions should not be confused with format extensions <tt>html</tt>, <tt>js</tt>, <tt>xml</tt>, etc. A format must be supplied to match a formated file. +hello/index+ will never match +hello/index.html.erb+.
