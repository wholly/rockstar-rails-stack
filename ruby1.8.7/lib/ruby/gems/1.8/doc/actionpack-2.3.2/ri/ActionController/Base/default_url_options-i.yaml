  body: "Overwrite to implement a number of default options that all url_for-based methods will use. The default options should come in the form of a hash, just like the one you would use for url_for directly. Example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  def default_url_options(options)\n    { :project =&gt; @project.active? ? @project.url_name : &quot;unknown&quot; }\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: As you can infer from the example, this is mostly useful for situations where you want to centralize dynamic decisions about the urls as they stem from the business domain. Please note that any individual url_for call can always override the defaults set by this method.
