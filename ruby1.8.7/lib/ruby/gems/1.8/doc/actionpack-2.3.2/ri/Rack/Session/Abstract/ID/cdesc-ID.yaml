  body: "ID sets up a basic framework for implementing an id based sessioning service. Cookies sent to the client for maintaining sessions will only contain an id reference. Only #get_session and #set_session are required to be overwritten."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: All parameters are optional.

  contents:

    label: "*"
    body: ":key determines the name of the cookie, by default it is 'rack.session'"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: ":path, :domain, :expire_after, :secure, and :httponly set the related cookie options as by Rack::Response#add_cookie"
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: ":defer will not set a cookie in the response."
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: ":renew (implementation dependent) will prompt the generation of a new session id, and migration of data to be referenced at the new id. If :defer is set, it will be overridden and the cookie will be set."

    body: ":sidbits sets the number of bits in length that a generated session id will be."
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P
