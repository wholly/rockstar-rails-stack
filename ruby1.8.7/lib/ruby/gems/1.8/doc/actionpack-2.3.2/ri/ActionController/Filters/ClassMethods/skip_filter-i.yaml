- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Removes the specified filters from the filter chain. This only works for method reference (symbol) filters, not procs. This method is different from skip_after_filter and skip_before_filter in that it will match any before, after or yielding around filter.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You can control the actions to skip the filter for with the <tt>:only</tt> and <tt>:except</tt> options, just like when you apply the filters.
