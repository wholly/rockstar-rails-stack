  body: The Active Record Helper makes it easier to create forms for records kept in instance variables. The most far-reaching is the <tt>form</tt> method that creates a complete form for all the basic content types of the record (not associations or aggregations, though). This is a great way of making the record quickly available for editing, but likely to prove lackluster for a complicated real-world form. In that case, it's better to use the <tt>input</tt> method and the specialized <tt>form</tt> methods in link:classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html
