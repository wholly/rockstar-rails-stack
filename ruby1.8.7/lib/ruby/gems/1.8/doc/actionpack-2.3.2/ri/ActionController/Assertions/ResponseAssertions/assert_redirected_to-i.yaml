  body: Assert that the redirection options passed in match those of the redirect called in the latest action. This match can be partial, such that assert_redirected_to(:controller =&gt; &quot;weblog&quot;) will also match the redirection of redirect_to(:controller =&gt; &quot;weblog&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;) and so on.
